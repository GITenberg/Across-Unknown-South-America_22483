<h2><a name="I_PREFACE" id="I_PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">South</span> America is, to my mind, "the Coming
Continent"&mdash;the Continent of the future. Everybody knows
the wealth of the Argentine, Peru, Chile, and Bolivia;
but the interior of Brazil, the largest and richest
country of all, not unlike forbidden Tibet, was perhaps
better known a century or two ago than now. Few
people realize that Brazil is larger than the United
States of North America, Germany, Portugal, and a
few other countries taken together. The interior is
practically a <i>terra incognita</i>&mdash;although the ancient
Jesuits and, at a later date, escaped slaves and native
rubber collectors have perhaps found their way inland
to a considerable distance.</p>

<p>When I started on the transcontinental journey I
did not take Europeans with me. It is not easy to
find men who can stand the strain of so long a journey.
I was also not surprised, although I was disappointed,
not to be able to obtain suitable officers in Brazil to
go part of the journey with me, so that I might be
relieved of a portion of the tedious scientific work of
the expedition, especially taking and computing daily
astronomical observations, to which much time has
to be devoted. All the work of all kinds eventually
fell upon my shoulders, and after departing I found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-vi" id="Pg_1-vi"></a>[<a href="./images/1-vi.png">vi</a>]</span>
myself filling the posts of surveyor, hydrographer,
cartographer, geologist, meteorologist, anthropologist,
botanist, doctor, veterinary surgeon, painter, photographer,
boat-builder, guide, navigator, etc. The muleteers
who accompanied me&mdash;only six, all counted&mdash;were
of little help to me&mdash;perhaps the reverse. So
that, considering all the adventures and misfortunes we
had, I am sure the reader, after perusing this book,
will wonder that we got back at all, and will be indulgent
enough to give me a little credit for saving, through
innumerable disasters&mdash;and perhaps not altogether by
mere luck&mdash;all my photographs (800 of them), all my
note-books, all my scientific observations, as well as
all the vocabularies I made of the various Indian
languages of tribes found on my way. Also for bringing
all my men out alive.</p>

<p>Here are, briefly, a few results of the expedition:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) First of all it has proved that, far from South
America's being an impenetrable continent&mdash;as was
believed&mdash;it is possible for any experienced traveller
to cross Brazil in any direction, if he could obtain
suitable followers.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) It has proved that the "millions of savage
Indians" supposed to be swarming all over the interior
of Brazil do not exist at all. All the pure Indians of
Central Brazil taken together may number a few
hundreds, or including half-castes (negroes and Portuguese),
a few thousands. As for the wild beasts and
snakes, no one ever need fear being troubled by them.
They are more afraid of you than you of them, you can
take my word for it. So that the terror which has
so far prevented people penetrating the interior has no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-vii" id="Pg_1-vii"></a>[<a href="./images/1-vii.png">vii</a>]</span>
reasonable ground, and this book ought to be the means
of making European people some day swarm to develop
that marvellous land now absolutely uninhabited.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Meteorological observations were recorded daily
right across Brazil.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Altitude observations, forming a complete chain
and including all minor undulations, were registered
across the entire South American continent from the
Atlantic coast at Rio de Janeiro as far as Callao on the
Pacific coast. The observations were taken with a
hypsometer and several excellent aneroids. These
show that many of the elevations marked on the
existing maps of Brazil are inaccurate, the error amounting
sometimes to several hundred feet.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) A complete survey was made of new country
between the Araguaya river and the Madeira, including
a careful survey of the Arinos river and the river
Arinos-Juruena, one of the most powerful tributaries of
the Amazon. In the small map, reproduced from the
best existing maps, at the end of the first volume,
several high mountain ranges, quite as high as the
Andes, may be noticed extending from north to south
between the rivers Madeira, Tapajoz, Xingu, Araguaya
and Tocantins. Those high ranges are merely the
work of imaginative cartographers, who have drawn
them to make the map look pretty. They do not
exist. I have left them in order to draw the attention
of the reader to them. The position of the Arinos-Juruena
is from 1 to 1&frac12; degrees farther west than it
is there drawn, and should be where I have marked the
red line of my route.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Everything that was of interest pictorially,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-viii" id="Pg_1-viii"></a>[<a href="./images/1-viii.png">viii</a>]</span>
geologically, botanically, or anthropologically was photographed
or sketched. Astronomical observations were
constantly taken to determine the positions of our
camps and places of importance.</p>

<p>Botanical and geological collections were made,
but unfortunately had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) During the journey the head waters of the
following important rivers were visited: The Rio
Vermelho, Rio Claro, Rio Araguaya, Rio Barreiros,
Rio das Mortes, Rio S. Louren&ccedil;o, the Cuyaba river,
the Xingu, the Paranatinga, the Paraguay river
(Paran&aacute;), the Rio Arinos, the Secundury.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) The entire course of the river Tapajoz was
studied, and also the entire course of the Amazon from
its mouth almost to its birthplace in the Andes.</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) Useful vocabularies were drawn up of the
following Indian languages: Bororo, Apiacar, Mundurucu,
Campas or Antis.</p>

<p>(<i>k</i>) The expedition has furthermore shown that it
is possible with poor material in the way of followers
to accomplish work of unusual difficulty.</p>

<p>(<i>l</i>) That it is possible for people in a normal condition
of health to go at least sixteen days without
food while doing hard work.</p>

<p>(<i>m</i>) That it is possible to cross an entire continent&mdash;for
one entire year&mdash;in the company of dangerous and
lazy criminals without any weapon for protection&mdash;not
even a penknife&mdash;and to bring forth from such poor
material remarkable qualities of endurance, courage, and
almost superhuman energy.</p>

<p>(<i>n</i>) Last, but not least, on that expedition I was
able to collect further evidence that a theory I had long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-ix" id="Pg_1-ix"></a>[<a href="./images/1-ix.png">ix</a>]</span>
held as to the present shape of the earth was correct.
I had never believed in the well-known theory that
a continent, now submerged, once existed between
America, Europe and Africa&mdash;in other words, where
the Atlantic Ocean is now. That theory has found
many followers. In support of it one is told that such
islands as Madeira, the Canaries, the Azores, are the
topmost peaks of a now partly submerged range of
mountains which once stood upon that vanished continent.
It is also a common belief that Northern Africa
underwent the contrary process, and was pushed up
from under the sea. That is why&mdash;it is said&mdash;the
Sahara Desert, which was formerly, without doubt,
an ocean bed, is now dry and above water.</p>

<p>One has only to look at any map of the entire world
to see what really happened to the earth in days long
gone by. Let me first of all tell you that there never
existed a continent between Africa and South America.
In fact, I doubt whether there is as much as a square
mile between those two continents more submerged
to-day than it was thousands upon thousands of years
ago.</p>

<p>Here is what really happened. The earth at one
period changed its shape&mdash;when, is merely guesswork,
and is of no consequence here&mdash;and the crust of the
earth&mdash;not the core, mind you&mdash;split into two great
gaps from Pole to Pole, with a number of other minor
fissures. In other words, the earth opened just like
the skin of an over-heated baked apple. The African
and American continents, as well as Australasia, with
New Guinea, the Celebes Islands, the Philippine Archipelago
and China, which before that event formed part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-x" id="Pg_1-x"></a>[<a href="./images/1-x.png">x</a>]</span>
of one immense continent, thus became divided, leaving
North and South America isolated, between the two
great Oceans&mdash;the Atlantic and the Pacific&mdash;which
were then, and only then, formed.</p>

<p>It is easy, by looking intelligently at a map, to
reconstruct the former shape of the world. You will
notice that the most western portion of Africa fits
exactly into the gap between North and South America,
while the entire African coast between Dahomey and
the Cape Colony fits in perfectly in all its indentations
and projections into the coast line of South America.
The shores of Western Europe in those days were
joined to North America, and find to-day their almost
parallel and well-fitting coast line on the east coast of
the United States and Canada. On the opposite side
of the world, the western side of South America, the
same conditions can be noticed, although the division
of the two continents (America and Asia) is there much
wider. Fragments were formed, leaving innumerable
islands scattered in the Pacific Ocean, half-way between
the actual continents of Asia, Australia and America.
A mere glance is sufficient to see how well Australia
fits in along the Chilian and Peruvian coast, the great
island of New Guinea along part of Peru and Ecuador,
and the west coast of the Central American Isthmus.
The Philippine Islands lay probably in those days
alongside of Guatemala, while California bordered on
Japan.</p>

<p>Such immense rivers as the Amazon, and its portentous
tributaries flowing from south to north, were
also formed perhaps at that time, great fissures caused
by the sudden splitting and cooling of the earth's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xi" id="Pg_1-xi"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xi.png">xi</a>]</span>
crust becoming the river beds. So perhaps was formed
the giant ca&ntilde;on of Colorado and the immense fissures
in the earth's crust that occur in Central Asia, in
Central Africa, and, as we shall see, on the central
plateau of Brazil.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Antarctic continent was once
joined to South America, Australia and Africa. During
the last Antarctic expeditions it has been shown that
the same geological formation exists in South America
as in the Antarctic plateau. On perusing this book,
the reader will be struck by the wonderful resemblance
between the Indians of South America, the Malay
races of Asia, and the tribes of Polynesia. I maintain
that they not only resemble each other, but are actually
the same people in different stages of development,
and naturally influenced to a certain extent by climatic
and other local conditions. Those people did not come
there, as has been supposed, by marching up the entire
Asiatic coast, crossing over the Behring Straits and
then down the American coast, nor by means of any
other migration. No, indeed; it is not they who have
moved, but it is the country under them which has
shifted and separated them, leaving members of the
same race thousands of miles apart.</p>

<p>I was able to notice among the Indians of Central
Brazil many words of Malay origin, others closely
resembling words of languages current among tribes of
the Philippine Islands. The anthropometric measurements
which I took of South American Indians corresponded
almost exactly with those of natives of the
Sulu Archipelago and the island of Mindanao.</p>

<p>I hope some day to use the wealth of material I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xii" id="Pg_1-xii"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xii.png">xii</a>]</span>
have collected among innumerable tribes on the Asiatic
coast, on the islands of the Pacific Ocean, in South
America and in Africa, in making a comparative study
of those peoples. It should prove interesting enough.
I have no space here to go deeply into the subject, as
this is merely a book descriptive of South America. I
may add that the most ardent supporter of the above
theory is the celebrated explorer and scientist, Colonel
Marchand, of Fashoda fame&mdash;a man who has studied
and understands the mysteries of this world better
than any man living.</p>

<p>My sincere thanks are due to the following gentlemen
for much politeness shown me in connection with the
expedition: To Mr. Gustave Babin, the famous writer
of Paris; to Mr. Manoel Bomfin (ex-deputy of Brazil),
to Senador Alcindo Guanabara, for the keen interest
taken in the expedition and for proposing to Congress
after my return that a grant of &pound;4,000 should be given
to me as a reward for the work done. I herewith also
express my gratitude to the Brazilian Government for
paying me that sum, which came in usefully to defray
part of the expenses of the expedition. To H.E. Dr.
Pedro de Toledo, Minister of Agriculture, for the
intelligent desire shown to help as much as he could
in the venture, and for kindly giving me the free use
of all the telegraphs in Brazil, including the Amazon
Cable, and other important privileges; to Dr. Jos&eacute;
Carlos Rodriguez for hospitality and much valuable
advice; to Dr. Paolo de Frontin, Conseilheiro Antonio
Prado, Dr. Jos&eacute; Pereira Rebon&ccedil;as and Mr. Mockill
and their respective Companies for the many privileges
granted me upon the various railways of which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-xiii" id="Pg_1-xiii"></a>[<a href="./images/1-xiii.png">xiii</a>]</span>
were the Presidents; to Colonel R. E. Brazil and
Commandante Macedo for their kind hospitality to
me while navigating the lower Tapajoz river; to Dr.
A. B. Leguia, President of the Peruvian Republic;
to the British Ministers at Petropolis, Lima, La Paz,
and Buenos Ayres, and the British Consuls of Rio de
Janeiro, Par&aacute;, Manaos, Iquitos, Antofogasta, Valparaiso;
finally to the British and American Residents at all
those places for much exquisite hospitality offered me.</p>

<p>Special thanks are due to Mr. Regis de Oliveira,
ex-Brazilian Minister in London, for valuable credentials
given me before my departure which paved the
way to the hearty reception I received everywhere
in Brazil.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Heart of Brazil&mdash;Brazil, its Size and its Immense Wealth&mdash;Rio de

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<span class="smcap">More</span> than three months to reach the spot?" asked
the cinematograph man in amazement. "Then perhaps
Monsieur is on a journey to Mars or the moon!
There is no spot on earth that takes so long to reach."
(Hearty laughter at his own wit.)</p>

<p>That exclamation, and wise words that follow, came
from the assistant of one of the largest firms of cinematograph
appliances in Paris, where I had called in
order to purchase a moving picture apparatus and
10,000 metres of film to be used on my forthcoming
journey across the South American continent.</p>

<p>The shop assistant had very honestly warned me
that if the films were to be used in a damp, tropical
climate, they must be exposed and developed within
three months of their manufacture. After that time
they would become so perforated and fogged as to
be quite useless. I had remarked that it would take
me more than three months to reach the spot where
I should begin to take cinematograph pictures.</p>

<p>"Will Monsieur please tell where is the spot where
he would be likely to use the films?" continued the
assistant, still overcome with surprise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-2" id="Pg_1-2"></a>[<a href="./images/1-2.png">2</a>]</span>
"In the heart of Brazil."</p>

<p>"In the heart of Brazil ... in the very heart of
Brazil?... <i>Oh, mon Dieu! mon Dieu!</i>" (More
laughter and a look of compassion at me.) "<i>Mais
nous avons une de nos maisons tout &agrave; fait pr&egrave;s de l&agrave;!</i>"
(Why, indeed, we have one of our factories quite close
to there.)</p>

<p>It was then my turn for hearty laughter and the
look of compassion.</p>

<p>"Pray," I inquired, "tell me more exactly. Where
is your factory close to the heart of Brazil?"</p>

<p>"It is quite, quite close. It is in Montreal, Canada.... You
will send your films there ... two or three
days' journey.... It will take us a week to develop
them ... two or three days for their return journey.
In a fortnight you will have them back again."</p>

<p>Quite close, indeed: only a distance of some 65&deg;
of latitude&mdash;or some 7170 kilometres as the crow flies&mdash;with
no direct communication by land or water!</p>

<p>That was the Frenchman's knowledge of geography;
but I find that the average Englishman, unless he is
directly interested in those countries, knows little
better, and perhaps even less. Time after time I have
been asked in London if Brazil were not a province
of Mexico, and whether it is not through Brazil that
the Americans are cutting the Panama Canal! There
are many who have a vague idea that Brazil is a German
colony; others, more patriotic, who claim it as an
English possession. Many of those who have looked
at the map of the world are under the impression that
Spanish is spoken in Brazil, and are surprised when
you tell them that Portuguese happens to be the local<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-3" id="Pg_1-3"></a>[<a href="./images/1-3.png">3</a>]</span>
language. Others, more enlightened in their geography
by that great play <i>Charley's Aunt</i>, imagine it a great
forest of nut trees. Others, more enlightened still,
believe it to be a land where you are constantly walking
in avenues adorned with wonderful orchids, with a
sky overhead swarming with birds of beautiful plumage.
I have been asked in all seriousness whether I found
the Andes quite flat&mdash;great prairies (the person had
heard of the Argentine <i>pampas</i> and got mixed up)&mdash;or
whether "it" was merely a large lagoon!</p>

<p>I could quote dozens more of these extreme cases
of ignorance, but of one thing I am certain, and that
is, that there are few people in the British Isles who
realize the actual size of the great Brazilian Republic.</p>

<p>Brazil is 8,524,778 square kilometres&mdash;with the
territory of the Acre newly acquired from Bolivia,
8,715,778 sq. kil. in extent; that is to say, it covers
an area larger than the United States of North America,
Germany, Portugal, Greece and Montenegro taken
together.</p>

<p>Some of the States of the Republic are larger
than some of the largest countries in Europe: such
as the State of the Amazonas with 1,894,724 sq. kil.;
the State of Matto Grosso with 1,378,784 sq. kil.; the
State of Par&aacute; with an area of 1,149,712 sq. kil.; the
State of Goyaz with 747,311 sq. kil.; the State of
Minas Geraes with 574,855 sq. kil.; the Acre territory,
191,000 sq. kil.</p>

<p>There are fewer people still who seriously appreciate
the great importance of that beautiful country&mdash;with no
exception the richest, the most wonderful in the world;
to my mind undoubtedly the continent of the future.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-4" id="Pg_1-4"></a>[<a href="./images/1-4.png">4</a>]</span>
Incalculable is the richness of Brazil in mineral
wealth. Magnificent yellow diamonds are to be found
in various regions, those of Minas Geraes and Matto
Grosso being famous for their purity and extraordinary
brilliancy; agates, moonstones, amethysts, emeralds,
sapphires, rubies, topazes, and all kinds of beautiful
rock crystals are plentiful. Gold exists in many regions
on the central plateau&mdash;but particularly in Minas
Geraes and Matto Grosso; and platinum in the States
of S&atilde;o Paulo, Minas Geraes, Sta. Catharina and Espirito
Santo; silver, mercury, lead, tin, salicylated and
natural copper are found in many places, as well as
graphite, iron, magnetic iron, oxide of copper, antimony,
argentiferous galena, malachite, manganese oxide, alum,
bituminous schist, anthracite, phosphate of lime,
sulphate of sodium, h&aelig;matite, monazitic sands (the
latter in large quantities), nitrate of potassium, yellow,
rose-coloured, and opalescent quartz, sulphate of iron,
sulphate of magnesia, potash, kaolin. Coal and lignite
of poor quality have been discovered in some regions,
and also petroleum, but not in large quantities.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-4.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-4_th.jpg" alt="Rio de Janeiro, showing the beautiful Avenida Central." title="Rio de Janeiro, showing the beautiful Avenida Central." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Rio de Janeiro, showing the beautiful Avenida Central.</p>
<hr />
<p>Springs of thermal and mineral waters are numerous&mdash;particularly
those of which the waters are sulphurous
or ferruginous; others contain arsenic and magnesia.</p>

<p>Most beautiful marble of various colours is to be
found, and also enormous quantities of mica and
amianth; porphyry and porphyroid granite, carbonated
and hydroxided iron, argillaceous schist, mica
schist.</p>

<p>Even richer than the mineral wealth is the botanical
wealth, hitherto dormant, of Brazil. Valuable woods
occur in many Brazilian forests&mdash;although it must not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-5" id="Pg_1-5"></a>[<a href="./images/1-5.png">5</a>]</span>
for one moment be imagined that entire forests are
to be found composed of useful woods. Indeed this
is not the case. Most of the woods are absolutely
valueless. Still, when it is realized that the forests of
Brazil extend for several millions of square kilometres,
it is easy to conceive that there is plenty of room among
a majority of poor trees for some good ones. Most
Brazilian woods are interesting on account of their
high specific gravity. Few, very few, will float on
water. On the central plateau, for instance, I could
not find a single wood which floated&mdash;barring, under
special conditions, the burity palm (<i>Mauritia vinifera</i>
M.). Along the banks of the Amazon and in the
northern part of Brazil this is not quite the case.
Some Brazilian woods, such as the iron-tree (pao-ferro),
whose name fitly indicates its character, are of extraordinary
hardness. The Brazilian forest, although
not specially rich in woods for building and naval
purposes, is nevertheless most abundant in lactiferous,
oliferous, fibrous, medicinal, resinous, and industrial
plants&mdash;such for instance as can be used for tanning
purposes, etc. No country in the world is as rich as
Brazil in its natural growth of rubber trees; nor have
I ever seen anywhere else such beautiful and plentiful
palms: the piassava (<i>Attalia fumifera</i> M.), the assahy
(<i>Euterpe oleracea</i> L.), the burity (<i>Mauritia vinifera</i> M.),
the carnahuberia (<i>Copernicia cerifera</i> M.), the palmito
(<i>Euterpe edulis</i> M.), and many others. I shall give a
more detailed description of the most important of
these plants as we proceed on our journey and find
them in their habitat.</p>

<p>Where, perhaps, Brazil's greatest richness lies is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-6" id="Pg_1-6"></a>[<a href="./images/1-6.png">6</a>]</span>
its hundreds of thousands of square miles of wonderful
pasture lands&mdash;perfectly ideal, with plenty of excellent
water and a delicious climate&mdash;capable of some day fattening
enough cattle to supply half the world with meat.</p>

<p>All these wonderful riches are absolutely dormant;
more than that, absolutely wasted for lack of population,
for lack of roads, trails, railways, or navigation
of the rivers. The coast of Brazil is highly civilized,
and so, more or less, is the immediate neighbourhood
of large cities; but the moment you leave those
cities, or the narrow zone along the few hundred kilometres
of railways which now exist, you immediately
relapse into the Middle Ages. When you get beyond
the comparatively narrow belt of semi-civilization,
along the coast, Brazil is almost as unknown as Mars
or the moon. The people who know least the country
are, curiously enough, the Brazilians themselves.
Owing greatly to racial apathy, they care little for the
trouble of developing their beautiful land. They watch
with envy strangers taking gold, diamonds, platinum,
and precious stones out of their country. They accuse
foreigners of going there to rob them of their wealth;
yet you seldom meet a Brazilian who will venture out
of a city to go and help himself. The Brazilian Government
is now beginning to wake up to the fact that it
is the possessor of the most magnificent country on
earth, and it is its wish to endeavour to develop it;
but the existing laws, made by short-sighted politicians,
are considered likely to hamper development for many
years to come.</p>

<p>Brazil is not lacking in intelligent men. Indeed, I
met in Rio de Janeiro and S. Paulo men who would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-7" id="Pg_1-7"></a>[<a href="./images/1-7.png">7</a>]</span>
be remarkable anywhere. Councillor Antonio Prado of
S. Paulo, for instance, was a genius who had done
wonders for his country. The great development of
the State of S. Paulo compared with other States is
chiefly due to that great patriot. Then the Baron de
Rio Branco&mdash;the shrewd diplomatist, who has lately
died&mdash;has left a monument of good work for his country.
The cession of the immensely rich tract of the Acre
Territory by Bolivia to Brazil is in itself a wonderful
achievement. Dr. Pedro de Toledo, the present
Minister of Agriculture, is a practical, well-enlightened,
go-ahead gentleman, who makes superhuman efforts,
and in the right direction, in order to place his country
among the leading states of the two Americas. Dr.
Lauro Severiano M&uuml;ller, the new Minister of Foreign
Affairs, is a worthy successor of Baron de Rio Branco.
There are many other persons of positive genius, such
as Senator Alcindo Guanabara, a man of remarkable
literary ability, and one of the few men in Brazil who
realize thoroughly the true wants of the Republic, a
man of large views, who is anxious to see his country
opened up and properly developed. Another remarkable
man is Dr. Jos&eacute; Carlos Rodriguez, the proprietor of
the leading newspaper in Rio&mdash;the <i>Jornal do Commercio</i>&mdash;and
the organizing genius of some of the most important
Brazilian commercial ventures. Having had an
American and English education, Dr. Rodriguez has been
able to establish in Rio the best edited and produced
daily newspaper in the world. Its complete service of
telegraphic news from all over the globe&mdash;on a scale
which no paper, even in England, can equal or even
approach&mdash;the moderate tone and seriousness of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-8" id="Pg_1-8"></a>[<a href="./images/1-8.png">8</a>]</span>
leading articles, its highly reliable and instructive
columns on all possible kinds of subjects by a specially
able staff of the cleverest writers in Brazil, and the
refined style in which it is printed, do great honour
to Dr. Rodriguez. Then comes another man of genius&mdash;Dr.
Francisco Pereira Passos, who, with Dr. Paulo
de Frontin, has been able in a few years to transform
Rio de Janeiro from one of the dirtiest and ugliest
cities in South America into the most beautiful. The
great drive around the beautiful bay, the spacious
new Avenida Central&mdash;with its parallel avenues of
great width&mdash;the construction of a magnificently
appointed municipal theatre, the heavenly road along
the Tijuca mountains encircling and overlooking the
great harbour, and a thousand other improvements of
the city are due to those two men. Dr. Paulo Frontin
has also been active in developing the network of
railways in Brazil. Whatever he has undertaken, he
has accomplished with great judgment and skill.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-8.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-8_th.jpg" alt="Rio de Janeiro as it was in 1903." title="Rio de Janeiro as it was in 1903." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Rio de Janeiro as it was in 1903.</p>
<hr />
<p>It would be impossible to enumerate here all the
clever men of Brazil. They are indeed too numerous.
The older generation has worked at great disadvantage
owing to the difficulty of obtaining proper education.
Many are the illiterate or almost illiterate people one
finds even among the better classes. Now, however,
excellent and most up-to-date schools have been
established in the principal cities, and with the great
enthusiasm and natural facility in learning of the
younger generations wonderful results have been obtained.
On account partly of the exhausting climate
and the indolent life that Brazilians are inclined to
lead, a good deal of the enthusiasm of youth dies out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-9" id="Pg_1-9"></a>[<a href="./images/1-9.png">9</a>]</span>
in later years; still Brazil has in its younger generation
a great many men who are ambitious and heartily
wish to render their country service. It is to be hoped
that their efforts may be crowned with success. It is
not talent which is lacking in Brazil, it is not patriotism;
but persistence is not perhaps the chief characteristic
among races of Portuguese descent. In these days of
competition it is difficult to accomplish anything great
without labour and trouble.</p>

<p>I left London on December 23rd, 1910, by the Royal
Mail steamship <i>Amazon</i>, one of the most comfortable
steamers I have ever been on.</p>

<p>We touched at Madeira, Pernambuco, and then at
Bahia. Bahia seen from the sea was quite picturesque,
with its two horizontal lines of buildings, one on the
summit of a low hill-range, the other along the water
line. A border of deep green vegetation separated the
lower from the upper town. A massive red building
stood prominent almost in the centre of the upper
town, and also a number of church towers, the high
dome of a church crowning the highest point.</p>

<p>I arrived in Rio de Janeiro on January 9th, 1911.</p>

<p>It is no use my giving a description of the city of
Rio de Janeiro. Everybody knows that it is&mdash;from
a pictorial point of view&mdash;quite a heavenly spot. Few
seaside cities on earth can expect to have such a glorious
background of fantastic mountains, and at the same
time be situated on one of the most wonderful harbours
known. I have personally seen a harbour which was
quite as strangely interesting as the Rio harbour&mdash;but
there was no city on it. It was the Malampaya Sound,
on the Island of Palawan (Philippine Archipelago).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-10" id="Pg_1-10"></a>[<a href="./images/1-10.png">10</a>]</span>
But such an <i>ensemble</i> of Nature's wonderful work
combined with man's cannot, to the best of my knowledge,
be found anywhere else than in Rio.</p>

<p>It does not do to examine everything too closely in
detail when you land&mdash;for while there are buildings of
beautiful architectural lines, there are others which suggest
the work of a pastrycook. To any one coming direct
from Europe some of the statuary by local talent which
adorns the principal squares gives a severe shock.
Ladies in evening dress and naked cupids in bronze
flying through national flags flapping in the wind,
half of their bodies on one side, the other half on the
other side of the flags, look somewhat grotesque as you
approach the statues from behind. But Rio is not the
only place where you see grotesque statuary&mdash;you have
not to go far from or even out of London to receive
similar and worse shocks. If Rio has some bad statues
it also possesses some remarkably beautiful ones by
the sculptor Bernardelli&mdash;a wonderful genius who is
now at the head of the Academy of Fine Arts in Rio.
This man has had a marvellous influence in the beautifying
of the city, and to him are due the impressive
lines of the finest buildings in Rio, such as the Academy
of Fine Arts. Naturally, in a young country like
Brazil&mdash;I am speaking of new Brazil, now wide awake,
not of the Brazil which has been asleep for some decades&mdash;perfection
cannot be reached in everything in one
day. It is really marvellous how much the Brazilians
have been able to accomplish during the last ten years
or so in their cities, on or near the coast.</p>

<p>Brazilians have their own way of thinking, which
is not ours, and which is to us almost incomprehensible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-11" id="Pg_1-11"></a>[<a href="./images/1-11.png">11</a>]</span>
They are most indirect in their thoughts and deeds&mdash;a
characteristic which is purely racial, and which they
themselves cannot appreciate, but which often shocks
Europeans. For instance, one of the most palatial
buildings in the Avenida Central was built only a
short time ago. In it, as became such an up-to-date
building, was established a lift. But do you think that
the architect, like all other architects anywhere else
in the world, would make the lift start from the ground
floor? No, indeed. The lift only starts from the
second floor up&mdash;and, if I remember rightly, you have
to walk some thirty-eight steps up a grand staircase
before you reach it! Do you know why? Because
the architect wished to compel all visitors to the
building to admire a window of gaudy coloured glass
half-way up the staircase. In this way they reason
about nearly everything. They have not yet mastered
the importance and due proportion of detail. Frequently
what is to us a trifling detail is placed by them
in the forefront as the most important point of whatever
they undertake.</p>

<p>Thanks to the strong credentials I carried&mdash;among
which were letters from H.E. Regis de Oliveira, Brazilian
Minister in London&mdash;I was received in Rio de Janeiro
with the utmost consideration and kindness. From the
President of the Republic to the humblest citizens,
all with no exception treated me with charming
civility. My stay in Rio was a delightful one. The
Brazilians of the principal cities were most courteous
and accomplished, and it was a great pleasure to
associate with them. Intense interest was shown by
the Government of the country and by the people in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-12" id="Pg_1-12"></a>[<a href="./images/1-12.png">12</a>]</span>
my plan to cross the continent. Dr. Pedro de Toledo,
the Minister of Agriculture, was specially interested
in the scheme, and it was at first suggested that the
expedition should be an Anglo-Brazilian one, and that
I should be accompanied by Brazilian officers and
soldiers. Colonel Rondon, a well-known and brave
officer, was ordered by the Government to find suitable
volunteers in the army to accompany my expedition.
After a long delay, Colonel Rondon informed me that
his search had been unsuccessful. Colonel Rondon said
he would have gladly accompanied the expedition himself,
had he not been detained in Rio by his duties as
Chief of the Bureau for the Protection and Civilization
of the Indians. Another officer offered his services in
a private capacity, but he having become involved in
a lawsuit, the negotiations were suddenly interrupted.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-12.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-12_th.jpg" alt="Dr. Pedro de Toledo, Minister of Agriculture, Brazil." title="Dr. Pedro de Toledo, Minister of Agriculture, Brazil." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Dr. Pedro de Toledo, Minister of Agriculture, Brazil.</p>
<hr />
<p>I endeavoured to find suitable civilians. No one
would go. The Brazilian forest, they all said, was
worse, more impenetrable than any forest in the world.
Brazilian rivers were broader, deeper and more dangerous
than any river on earth. Wild beasts in Brazil
were more numerous and wilder than the wildest animals
of Africa or Asia. As for the Indians of Central Brazil,
they were innumerable&mdash;millions of them&mdash;and ferocious
beyond all conception. They were treacherous cannibals,
and unfortunate was the person who ventured
among them. They told stories galore of how the few
who had gone had never come back. Then the insects,
the climate, the terrible diseases of Central Brazil were
worse than any insect, any climate, any terrible disease
anywhere. That is more or less the talk one hears in
every country when about to start on an expedition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-13" id="Pg_1-13"></a>[<a href="./images/1-13.png">13</a>]</span>
I had prepared my expedition carefully, at a cost
of some &pound;2,000 for outfit. Few private expeditions
have ever started better equipped. I carried ample
provisions for one year (tinned meats, vegetables,
1,000 boxes of sardines, fruits, jams, biscuits, chocolate,
cocoa, coffee, tea, etc.), two serviceable light tents, two
complete sets of instruments for astronomical and
meteorological observations, and all the instruments
necessary for making an accurate survey of the country
traversed. Four excellent aneroids&mdash;which had been
specially constructed for me&mdash;and a well-made hypsometrical
apparatus with six boiling-point thermometers,
duly tested at the Kew Observatory, were carried in
order to determine accurately the altitudes observed.
Then I possessed two prismatic and six other excellent
compasses, chronometers, six photographic cameras,
specially made for me, with the very best Zeiss and
Goertz lenses, and some 1,400 glass photographic
plates&mdash;including some for colour photography. All
articles liable to be injured by heat and damp were
duly packed in air- and water-tight metal cases with
outer covers of wood. Then I carried all the instruments
necessary for anthropometric work, and painting
materials for recording views and scenes in colours when
the camera could not be used, as at night or when the
daylight was insufficient. I had a complete supply of
spades, picks, large saws, axes, and heavy-bladed knives
(two feet long) for cutting our way through the forest,
making roads and constructing rafts, canoes and
temporary bridges.</p>

<p>I carried, as usual, very little medicine&mdash;merely
three gallons of castor oil, a few bottles of iodine, some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-14" id="Pg_1-14"></a>[<a href="./images/1-14.png">14</a>]</span>
formiate of quinine, strong carbolic and arsenical soaps,
permanganate and other powerful disinfectants, caustic&mdash;that
was about all. These medicines were mostly
to be used, if necessary, upon my men and not upon
myself.</p>

<p>I had twelve of the best repeating rifles that are
made, as well as excellent automatic pistols of the most
modern type, and several thousand rounds of ammunition&mdash;chiefly
soft-nosed bullets. These weapons were
carried in order to arm my followers. Although I had
several first-class rifles for my own use&mdash;following my
usual custom, I never myself carried any weapons&mdash;not
even a penknife&mdash;upon my person except when
actually going after game. Again on this occasion&mdash;as
on previous journeys&mdash;I did not masquerade about
in fancy costumes such as are imagined to be worn by
explorers, with straps and buckles and patent arrangements
all over. I merely wore a sack coat with ample
pockets, over long trousers such as I use in town. Nor
did I wear any special boots. I always wore comfortable
clothes everywhere, and made no difference in my
attire between the Brazilian forest and Piccadilly,
London. When it got too hot, naturally I removed
the coat and remained in shirt sleeves; but that was
all the difference I ever made in my wearing apparel
between London and Central Brazil. I have never
in my life adopted a sun helmet&mdash;the most absurd,
uncomfortable and grotesque headgear that was ever
invented. I find, personally, that a common straw
hat provides as much protection as any healthy person
requires from the equatorial sun.</p>

<p>If I give these details, it is merely because they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-15" id="Pg_1-15"></a>[<a href="./images/1-15.png">15</a>]</span>
might be of some use to others&mdash;not because I wish to
advertise these facts; and also, if I do not give the
names of the firms which supplied the various articles,
it is because&mdash;unlike many other explorers&mdash;I have
been in the custom of never letting my name be used
in any way whatever for advertising purposes.</p>

<p>There are many people who are enthusiastic over
a dangerous project when they first hear of it, but on
thinking it over and talking with friends and relatives
their enthusiasm soon wears off. That is what happened
in Rio. I wasted some time in Rio&mdash;socially most
enjoyably employed&mdash;in order to get followers and come
to some suitable arrangement with the Government.
I was deeply indebted to the Minister of Agriculture,
Dr. Pedro de Toledo, for allowing me the free use
of all the telegraphs in Brazil, and also for a special
permission (of which I never availed myself) to use, if
necessary, the flotilla of Government boats on the
Amazon. Credentials were also furnished me, but
owing to the way in which they were worded they were
more of a danger to me than a protection. They
actually proved to be so once or twice when I was
compelled to present them. The expedition was considered
so dangerous that the Government published
broadcast statements in the official and other papers
stating that "Mr. A. H. Savage Landor's expedition
across Brazil was undertaken solely at his own initiative
and absolutely at his own risk and responsibility."
They also circulated widely the statement that I had
promised not in any way to injure or hurt the native
Indians, that I would not supply them with firearms
of any kind, and that I would in no way ill-treat them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-16" id="Pg_1-16"></a>[<a href="./images/1-16.png">16</a>]</span>
I had gladly promised all that. I had not even dreamt
of doing any of those things to the natives, and naturally
I strictly kept my promise.</p>

<p>In a luxurious Administration car placed at my
disposal by Dr. Paulo Frontin I left Rio by the Central
Railway, escorted as far as S. Paulo by Dr. Carlo da
Fonseca, a railway engineer, sent to look after my
comfort by the Central Brazilian Railway Company.</p>

<p>On approaching S. Paulo in the early morning I was
much struck by the activity of the waking city as
compared with Rio. Carts were dashing to and fro
in the streets, the people walked along fast as if they
had something to do, and numerous factory chimneys
ejected clouds of smoke, puffing away in great white
balls. The people stopped to chat away briskly as if
they had some life in them. It seemed almost as if
we had suddenly dropped into an active commercial
European city. The type of people, their ways and
manners were different from those of the people of Rio&mdash;but
equally civil, equally charming to me from the
moment I landed at the handsome railway station.</p>

<p>With a delicious climate&mdash;owing to its elevation&mdash;with
a population of energetic people chiefly of Italian
origin, instead of the apathetic mixture of Portuguese
and negro, S. Paulo was indeed the most flourishing
city of the Brazilian Republic. Its yearly development
was enormous. Architecturally it was gradually
becoming modified and improved, so that in a few
years it will be a very beautiful city indeed. Already
the city possessed beautiful avenues and a wonderful
theatre.</p>

<p class="fsc">Senador Alcindo Guanabara, a great Literary Genius and Patriot of Brazil.</p>
<hr />
<p>Everybody knows what an important part the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-17" id="Pg_1-17"></a>[<a href="./images/1-17.png">17</a>]</span>
enterprising people of S. Paulo have played in the
expansion and colonization of the central and southern
regions of Brazil. The early activity of the Paulistas&mdash;it
dates back to 1531&mdash;can be traced from the River
Plate on the south, to the head waters of the Madeira
in Matto Grosso on the east, and as far as Piantry on
the north.</p>

<p>I cannot indulge here, as I should like to do, in
giving a complete historical sketch of the amazing
daring and enterprise of those early explorers and
adventurers and of their really remarkable achievements.
Their raids extended to territories of South
America which are to-day almost impenetrable. It
was really wonderful how they were able to locate and
exploit many of the most important mines within an
immense radius of their base.</p>

<p>The history of the famous Bandeiras, under the
command of Raposo, and composed of Mamelucos
(crosses of Portuguese and Indians) and Tupy Indians,
the latter a hardy and bold race, which started out on
slave-hunting expeditions, is thrilling beyond words and
reads almost like fiction. The ways of the Bandeirantes
were sinister. They managed to capture immense
numbers of slaves, and must have killed as many as
they were able to bring back or more. They managed,
therefore, to depopulate the country almost entirely,
the few tribes that contrived to escape destruction
seeking refuge farther west upon the slopes of the
Andes.</p>

<p>Although the Brazilians&mdash;even in official statistics&mdash;estimate
the number of pure savage Indians in the
interior at several millions, I think that the readers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-18" id="Pg_1-18"></a>[<a href="./images/1-18.png">18</a>]</span>
this book will be convinced, as I was in my journey
across the widest and wildest part of Brazil, that perhaps
a few hundreds would be a more correct estimate.
Counting half-castes, second, third and fourth crosses,
and Indians who have entirely adopted Portuguese
ways, language and clothes, they may perhaps amount
to several thousand&mdash;but that is all.</p>

<p>The Jesuits endeavoured to save the Indians from
the too-enterprising Bandeirantes, with the result that
the missions were destroyed also and the missionaries
driven away or killed.</p>

<p>Brazil occupies to-day in the world's knowledge
practically the same position that forbidden Tibet
occupied some fifteen or twenty years ago. It was
easier to travel all over Brazil centuries ago than now.</p>

<p>The Bandeirantes became extraordinarily daring.
In 1641 another slave-hunting Paulista expedition
started out to sack the missions of Paraguay and make
great hauls of converted Indians. The adventurers
invaded even the impenetrable territory of the Chaco.
But, history tells us, the Jesuits, who were well prepared
for war, were not only able to trap the 400
Paulista Bandeirantes in an ambuscade and to set
free their prisoners, but killed a great number of them,
120 of the adventurous Bandeirantes thus supplying
a handsome dinner for the cannibal Chaco Indians.
Infuriated at the reverse, the survivors of the expedition
destroyed all the missions and Indian villages
upon their passage, not one escaping. They came to
grief, however, in the end. Few only returned home
to tell the tale. That lesson practically ended the
slave-hunting expeditions on a large scale of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-19" id="Pg_1-19"></a>[<a href="./images/1-19.png">19</a>]</span>
Bandeirantes, but not the expeditions of parties in
search of gold and diamonds, many of which were
extraordinarily successful. Minor expeditions were
undertaken in which Paulista adventurers were employed
under contract in various parts of Brazil for
such purposes as to fight the Indians or to break up
the so-called Republic of the Palmeiras&mdash;an unpleasant
congregation of negroes and Indians.</p>

<p>The astonishing success which the dauntless Paulistas
had obtained everywhere made them thirst for
gold and diamonds, which they knew existed in the
interior. They set out in great numbers&mdash;men, women,
and children&mdash;in search of wealth and fresh adventure.
Several of the towns in distant parts of the interior
of Brazil owe their origin to this great band of adventurers,
especially in the section of Brazil now called
Minas Geraes. The adventurers were eventually outnumbered
and overpowered by swarms of Brazilians
from other parts of the country, and by Portuguese
who had quickly arrived in order to share in the wealth
discovered by the Paulistas. They finally had to
abandon the mines which they had conquered at an
appalling loss of human life.</p>

<p>The ardour of the Paulistas was quelled but not
extinguished. About the year 1718 they started afresh
to the north-west in the direction of the Cuyaba River
and of Goyaz, where they had learnt that gold and
diamonds of great beauty were to be found. So many
joined in these adventurous expeditions that S. Paulo
was left almost depopulated. That is how those
immense territories of Goyaz and Matto Grosso were
discovered and annexed to S. Paulo, but eventually,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-20" id="Pg_1-20"></a>[<a href="./images/1-20.png">20</a>]</span>
owing to their size, these became split up into <i>capitaneas</i>,
then into states.</p>

<p>The Paulistas were great fighters. In 1739 they
were able to drive away the Spaniards from Rio Grande
do Sul and forced them to retreat into Uruguay. After
many years of vicissitudes in war and exploration&mdash;after
phases of prosperity, oppression, and even of
almost total ruin, owing to maladministration and
official greed&mdash;things began to look up again for S&atilde;o
Paulo when the port of Santos was thrown open to the
trade of the world, in 1808. The history of Brazil
during the last hundred years is too well known to be
repeated here.</p>

<p>During the last few years the State of S&atilde;o Paulo
has attained amazing prosperity, principally from the
export of coffee&mdash;perhaps the most delicious coffee in
the world. Although nearly all the rivers of the State
of S&atilde;o Paulo are absolutely useless for navigation, owing
to dangerous rapids, the State is intersected by innumerable
streams, large and small&mdash;of great importance
for purposes of irrigation and for the generation of
electric power. The most important harbour in the
State is Santos. Ubatuba, S&atilde;o Sebasti&atilde;o, Iguape and
Carranca are ports of less consequence. It is principally
from Santos that the exportation of coffee takes
place.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-20.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-20_th.jpg" alt="The Municipal Theatre, Rio de Janeiro." title="The Municipal Theatre, Rio de Janeiro." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">The Municipal Theatre, Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<hr />
<p>The State extends roughly in a parallelogram from
the ocean, south-east, to the Parana River, north-west;
between the Rio Grande, to the north, and the Rio
Paranapanema, to the south, the latter being two
tributaries of the Parana River. The State can be
divided into two distinct zones, one comprising the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-21" id="Pg_1-21"></a>[<a href="./images/1-21.png">21</a>]</span>
low-lying lands of the littoral, the second the tablelands
of the interior north-west of the Serra Cadias,
Serra do Paranapiacaba and Serra do Mar&mdash;along
or near the sea-coasts. The first zone by the sea is
extremely hot and damp, with swampy and sandy soil
often broken up by spurs from the neighbouring hill
ranges. It is well suited for the cultivation of rice.
The second zone, which covers practically all the
elevated country between the coast ranges and the
Parana River, is extraordinarily fertile, with a fairly
mild climate and abundant rains during the summer
months. During the winter the days are generally
clear and dry.</p>

<p>It is in that second zone that immense coffee
plantations are to be found, the red soil typical of that
tableland being particularly suitable for the cultivation
of the coffee trees.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary here to go into detailed
statistics, but it may be sufficient to state, on the
authority of the Directoria de Estatistica Commercial
of Rio de Janeiro, that during the first eleven months
of the year 1912, 10,465,435 sacks of coffee were exported
from Brazil&mdash;mostly from S&atilde;o Paulo&mdash;showing
an increase of 548,854 sacks on eleven months of the
previous year. That means a sum of &pound;40,516,006
sterling, or &pound;5,218,564 more than the previous year; the
average value of the coffee being, in 1912, 58,071
milreis, or, taking the pound sterling at 15 milreis,
&pound;3 17<i>s.</i> 5&frac12;<i>d.</i> a sack&mdash;an increase in price of 4,628
reis = 6<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> per sack, on the sales of 1911.</p>

<p>The other exports from the State of S&atilde;o Paulo are
flour, mandioca, cassava, bran, tanned hides, horns,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-22" id="Pg_1-22"></a>[<a href="./images/1-22.png">22</a>]</span>
fruit (pineapples, bananas, cocoanuts, abacates (alligator
pears), oranges, tangerines, etc.), wax, timber
(chiefly jacarand&agrave; or rosewood), a yearly decreasing
quantity of cotton, steel and iron, mica, goldsmith's
dust, dried and preserved fish, scrap sole leather,
salted and dry hides, wool, castor seed or bean, crystal,
<i>mate</i>, rice, sugar, rum (<i>aguardente</i>) and other articles
of minor importance.</p>

<p>The area of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo has been put
down at 290,876 sq. kil.</p>

<p>Its population in 1908 was calculated at 3,397,000,
and it had then more inhabitants to the square kilometre
than any other part of Brazil. It is useless to
give actual figures of the population, for none are
reliable. Although this State is the most civilized in
Brazil, yet a good portion of its western territory is
still practically a <i>terra incognita</i>, so that even the best
official figures are mere guess-work.</p>

<p>Owing to the wonderful foresight of that great man,
Antonio Prado&mdash;to my mind the greatest man in
Brazil&mdash;a new industry has been started in the State
of S&atilde;o Paulo which promises to be as lucrative and
perhaps more so than the cultivation of coffee. It is
the breeding of cattle on a gigantic scale, the magnificent
prairies near Barretos, in the northern part of the
State, being employed for the purpose. Slaughter-houses
and refrigerating plants of the most modern
type are to be established there, and with such a practical
man as Antonio Prado at the head of the enterprise,
the scheme is bound, I should think, to be a
success. With the population of the Republic gradually
increasing&mdash;it could be centupled and there would still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-23" id="Pg_1-23"></a>[<a href="./images/1-23.png">23</a>]</span>
be plenty of room for as many people again&mdash;the
S&atilde;o Paulo State will one day supply most of the meat
for the principal markets of Brazil. A good deal of
the cattle which will eventually be raised on the marvellous
campos of Matto Grosso and Goyaz, and destined
to Southern Brazilian markets, will find its way
to the coast via S&atilde;o Paulo. The rest will travel
perhaps via Minas Geraes.</p>

<p>For some years cattle breeding has been carried
on successfully enough, but on a comparatively small
scale, in this State. Experiments have been made in
crossing the best local breeds, principally the Carac&ugrave;,
with good foreign breeds, such as the Jersey, Durham
and Dutch stocks. Pigs of the Berkshire, Yorkshire,
Canasters and Tatus type are the favourites in S&atilde;o
Paulo, and seem to flourish in that climate.</p>

<p>Sheep-breeding is also successful, and would be
even more so if proper care were taken of the animals.
Of the wool-producing kinds, those preferred are the
Leicester, Merino, Oxford and Lincoln, the Oxford
having already produced quite excellent results.</p>

<p>The Government of the State, I understand, is at
present giving great attention to the matter, and is
using discrimination in the selection of suitable breeds
from foreign countries in order to procure the best
animals of various kinds for the production of meat,
butter, and hides. I also believe that an endeavour
is being made to produce in the State a good breed of
horses for military and other purposes.</p>

<p>The elevation of S&atilde;o Paulo city is 2,450 ft. above
the sea level.</p>

at my disposal when I left S&atilde;o Paulo, and a railway

in front of the engine, where I could obtain the full

to pass.</p>

<hr />
<p>The Paulista Railway was interesting, as it was
the first line in Brazil constructed entirely with Brazilian
capital. The line was begun in 1870, but since that
date several extensions have been successfully laid out.
Up to 1909 the lines owned and worked by the Paulista
Railway were the 1&middot;60-metre-gauge trunk line from
Jundiahy to Descalvado (north of S. Paulo), and the
two branch lines of the same gauge from Cordeiro to
Rio Claro; Laranja Azeda to S. Veridiana; the two
branch lines of 0&middot;60 m. gauge from Descalvado to Aurora
and from Porto Ferreira to S. Rita do Passo Quatro.
Then they possessed the one-metre trunk line from
Rio Claro to Araraquara, with the following branch
and extension lines: Visconde de Rio Claro to Jahu;
Araraquara to Jaboticabal; Bebedouro to Barretos;
Mogy Guasso Rinc&atilde;o to Pontal; S. Carlos to S. Euxodia
and Rib. Bonita; Agudos to Dois Corregos and Piratininga;
and the loop line through Brotas. Of the
total charters for 1,114 kil. 261 have been granted by
the Federal Government and are under their supervision,
whereas 583 kil. are under charter granted by
the State of S&atilde;o Paulo.</p>

<p>The following statistics taken from the last Brazilian
Year Book show the wonderful development of the
passenger and goods traffic on the Paulista Railway:&mdash;</p>

<p>At Jundiahy the Paulista Company has extensive
repairing shops for engines. Formerly they had there
also shops for building carriages, but these are now
constructed at the Rio Claro Station, partly from
material which comes from abroad. The rolling stock
of the Company is excellent in every way&mdash;quite up-to-date,
and kept in good condition&mdash;almost too luxurious
for the kind of passengers it has to carry.</p>

<p>It is principally after leaving Campinas that the
scenery of the line is really beautiful&mdash;wonderful undulating
country&mdash;but with no habitations, except,
perhaps, a few miserable sheds miles and miles apart.
At Nueva Odena the Government is experimenting
with Russian and Italian labourers, for whom it has
built a neat little colony. After a time each labourer
becomes the owner of the land he has cultivated. I
am told that the colony is a success.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Coffee&mdash;The Dumont Railway</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> object in travelling by the Paulista Railway was
to inspect the line on my way to the immense coffee
plantations at Martinho Prado, owned by Conselheiro
Antonio Prado. The estate is situated at an elevation
above the sea level of 1,780 ft., upon fertile
red soil. It is difficult, without seeing them, to
realize the extent and beauty of those coffee groves&mdash;miles
and miles of parallel lines of trees of a healthy,
dark green, shining foliage. A full-grown coffee tree,
as everybody knows, varies in height from 6 ft. to 14
or 15 ft. according to the variety, the climate, and
quality of the soil. It possesses a slender stem,
straight and polished, seldom larger than 3 to 5 in.
in diameter, from which shoot out horizontal or slightly
oblique branches&mdash;the larger quite close to the soil&mdash;which
gradually diminish in length to its summit.
The small white blossom of the coffee tree is not unlike
jessamine in shape and also in odour. The fruit,
green in its youth, gradually becomes of a yellowish
tint and then of a bright vermilion when quite ripe&mdash;except
in the Botucat&uacute; kind, which remains yellow to
the end.</p>

<p>The fruit contains within a pericarp a pulp slightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-27" id="Pg_1-27"></a>[<a href="./images/1-27.png">27</a>]</span>
viscous and sweet, within which, covered by a membrane,
are the two hemispherical coffee beans placed
face to face and each covered by a tender pellicle. It
is not unusual to find a single bean in the fruit, which
then takes the shape of an ellipsoid grooved in its longer
axis&mdash;and this is called <i>moka</i> owing to the resemblance
which it bears to the coffee of that name.</p>

<p>The coffee chiefly cultivated in Brazil is the <i>Arabica</i>
L. and to a small extent also the <i>Liberica</i> Hiern, but
other varieties have developed from those, and there
are crosses of local kinds such as the Maragogype, which
takes its name from the place where it was discovered
(Bahia Province). Those varieties are locally known
as Creoulo, Bourbon, Java, Botucat&uacute; (or yellow bean
coffee), the Maragogype, and the Goyaz. The Creoulo,
the Botucat&uacute; and the Maragogype are wilder and show
more resistance than the Java and Bourbon sorts,
which are nevertheless more productive under good
conditions and with careful cultivation, which the first
three qualities do not exact.</p>

<p>The coffee tree is a most serviceable plant, every
part of which can be used. Its wood is much used in
cabinet making, and makes excellent fuel; its leaves,
properly torrefied, and then stewed in boiling water,
give a palatable kind of tea; from the sweet pulp of
its fruit an agreeable liqueur can be distilled; from
its beans can be made the beverage we all know, and
from the shells and residue of the fruit a good fertilizer
can be produced.</p>

<p>The chemical examination of the cinders of the
coffee bean shows that it contains 65&middot;25 per cent of
potash, 12&middot;53 per cent of phosphoric acid, 11&middot;00 per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-28" id="Pg_1-28"></a>[<a href="./images/1-28.png">28</a>]</span>
cent of magnesia, 6&middot;12 per cent of lime, and some
traces of sulphuric and salicylic acid, oxide of iron and
chlorine.</p>

<p>An interesting study has been made by Dr. Dafert
of the weight of the various components of the coffee
tree at different ages, from which it appears that the
proportion of potash increases progressively in the
organs as they are more and more distant from the
roots. The contrary is the case with lime and phosphoric
acid, which preponderate generally in the seeds.</p>

<p>With this knowledge a scientific cultivator can
judge exactly how to treat the exigencies of the different
trees at different ages. Naturally, the condition of
the soil has to be taken into consideration in any case.
According to experiments made by Dr. Dafert each
kilo of coffee beans has extracted from the soil&mdash;potash
0&middot;7880 gramme; phosphoric acid 0&middot;4020 gramme;
magnesia 0&middot;3240 gramme; lime 0&middot;1470 gramme.</p>

<p>These experiments apply merely to coffee grown in
Brazil, and are no doubt at variance with experiments
on coffee grown elsewhere. Taking all things into consideration,
it has been proved by chemical analysis that
the Brazilian coffee comes as near as any in its components
to what the normal or perfect coffee should be.</p>

<p>The soil, the elevation of the land, the zone and the
climate naturally have considerable influence on the
quality of the coffee. The <i>Coffea Arabica</i> seems to feel
happy enough in a temperate zone and at elevations
from 1,500 to 2,300 ft. The States of S&atilde;o Paulo,
Minas Geraes, Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo fulfil
most if not all these conditions.</p>

<p>The coffee trees can stand cold&mdash;if not of long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-29" id="Pg_1-29"></a>[<a href="./images/1-29.png">29</a>]</span>
duration&mdash;down to freezing-point, as well as a fairly
high temperature. Unlike the Liberia coffee, they
fare better on undulating or broken ground than on
the flat.</p>

<p>Two distinct seasons&mdash;the dry and the rainy&mdash;each
of about six months' duration&mdash;such as are found in
the above-mentioned States of Brazil, seem perfectly
to suit the growth of the coffee trees. The trees are
in bloom for three or four days some time during the
months of September to December. If the rains are
not abundant when the trees are in blossom, and
during the maturing of the fruits, the latter do not
develop properly, especially those at the end of the
branches, where the berries become dry before their
time or even do not form. If the rain comes too long
before the trees are in bloom it causes the blossoms to
open before their time and they are frequently spoiled
by the cold which follows. The coffee beans are collected
in April, during the dry weather.</p>

<p>The coffee trees are very sensitive to winds, cold
or hot, especially when blowing continuously in the
same direction, which causes the undue fall of leaves
and rupture of the bark at the neck of the roots. Wind,
indeed, is one of the most dangerous enemies of coffee
trees, and it is to obviate this danger that in many
countries&mdash;but not in Brazil&mdash;a protecting plantation
in lines of other trees&mdash;generally useful fruit trees&mdash;is
adopted in order to screen the coffee trees from the
prevailing wind, as well as to give a further income
from the fruit produced.</p>

<p>It has been proved that even from good trees below
a certain altitude the coffee is of inferior quality, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-30" id="Pg_1-30"></a>[<a href="./images/1-30.png">30</a>]</span>
above that height the crop becomes irregular. In zones
fully exposed to the sun the quality is superior to that
of regions where the sun does not reach or only reaches
for a short portion of the day.</p>

<p>The <i>Coffea Arabica</i> is not particularly exacting in
the quality of the soil, but the soil on which it flourishes
best is that formed in great part by decomposed vegetable
matter&mdash;as, for instance, from ancient trees
mixed with volcanic earth, such as the famous red earth
of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo. Volcanic cinders also are
said to be wonderful fertilizers for the soil, and well
adapted for the welfare of coffee trees.</p>

<p>One thing is undoubted, and that is that the State
of S&atilde;o Paulo possesses the ideal soil for coffee plantations.
Analysis has shown that, curiously enough, the
soil of S&atilde;o Paulo is not in itself very rich. It has an
insufficient quantity of fertilizing substances, particularly
of lime; but it should not be forgotten that
locality and climatic conditions must be taken into
serious consideration, and that we must not be misled
by the difference between the apparent and the real fertility
of the soil. What would be a poor soil in Europe
may prove to be an excellent one in a tropical country.
So the famous "red earth" of S&atilde;o Paulo, which in
a drier climate would be sterile and unproductive, is
there excellent because of its extremely permeable,
porous and powdery qualities.</p>

<p>The special terms used for naming the different
kinds of earth suitable for the cultivation of coffee are:
<i>terra roxa</i> (red earth), <i>massap&eacute;</i>, <i>salmor&atilde;o</i>, <i>catanduva</i>,
<i>terra de areia</i> (sand earth), <i>picarra</i> (stony earth), and
<i>pedreguelho</i> (stony earth).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-31" id="Pg_1-31"></a>[<a href="./images/1-31.png">31</a>]</span>
The <i>terra roxa</i> is an argillaceous, ferruginous earth
of diabasic origin, occasionally mixed with sand. It
contains salicylic acid, oxide of iron, alumina, phosphoric
acid, oxide of manganese, lime, magnesia, potash
and soda.</p>

<p>The <i>massap&eacute;</i>, originally decomposed gneiss-granitic
rock mixed with clay, contains oxide of iron. Its
occasional blackness is due to the decomposed vegetable
matter it embodies.</p>

<p>The <i>salmor&atilde;o</i> includes in its formation small stones
indicating the incomplete decomposition of the rock
from which it originates.</p>

<p>The <i>catanduva</i>&mdash;which is of inferior quality&mdash;is composed
of much disintegrated vegetable matter and fine
dust.</p>

<p>The names of the other kinds of earth well denote
their quality.</p>

<p>One reason why coffee cultivation is so popular in
Brazil is because of the general belief that no trouble
is required to look after the trees&mdash;a very mistaken
notion indeed. There is a marked difference between
plantations carefully looked after and those that are
not. More than usual care must be taken to select
the seed for new plantations. The young plants must
get strong in a nursery and then be transplanted into
proper soil, the prudent distance between trees being
generally from 9 to 12 ft. For the convenience of collecting
the beans and keeping the soil clean, a perfect
alignment in all directions is necessary. The most
suitable month for planting coffee in Brazil, according
to the authority of Dr. Dafert, is the month of July.</p>

<p>Great care must be taken of the trees themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-32" id="Pg_1-32"></a>[<a href="./images/1-32.png">32</a>]</span>
and of the soil around the trees, which must be kept
clean and absolutely free from grass. The capillary
roots of the trees extending horizontally near the
surface of the soil are much affected by the presence
of any other vegetation, and by the collection of insects
which this produces and harbours. Frost, rain, and the
heat of the sun naturally affect the trees more when
the soil is dirty than when kept clean. Many of the
coffee estates suffer considerably from insufficient labour.
The effects of this are quickly visible on the trees.
Artificial fertilization is useful, even necessary after a
number of years, and so is careful pruning in order to
keep the trees healthy, strong and clean.</p>

<p class="fsc">Antonio Prado's Coffee Estate.</p>
<hr />
<p>Coffee trees have many natural enemies&mdash;chiefly
vegetable and animal parasites&mdash;which mostly attack
the leaves. The <i>Ramularia Goeldiana</i>, a parasite not
unlike the <i>Cercospora Coffeicola</i>, is one of the worst,
and undoubtedly the chief offender in Brazil, although
great is the number of insects prejudicial to the trees.
The most terrible of all, perhaps, are the ants and
termites, such as the <i>Termes opacus</i>, which attack
and destroy the roots of young trees. The <i>cupim</i>
(<i>Termes album</i>) or white ant, and the <i>carregador</i> or
<i>Sauba</i>, a giant ant with which we shall get fully acquainted
later on our journey, are implacable enemies
of all plants. Also the <i>quen-quen</i>, another kind of ant.
These ants are so numerous that it is almost an impossibility
to extirpate them. Various ways are suggested
for their destruction, but none are really effective.
Certain larv&aelig;, flies and cochinilla, owing to their
sucking habits, deposit on the leaves and branches a
viscous sugary substance, which, on account of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-33" id="Pg_1-33"></a>[<a href="./images/1-33.png">33</a>]</span>
heat, causes fermentation known locally as <i>fumagina</i>.
This produces great damage. Birds pick and destroy
the berries when ripe; and caterpillars are responsible
for the absolute devastation of many coffee districts
in the Rio de Janeiro and S&atilde;o Paulo States. Other
pests of the <i>Heteroptera</i> type attack the roots to such
an extent as to cause the death of the trees.</p>

<p>Among the diseases of the trees are the <i>Aphelencus
Coffe&aelig;</i> and the <i>Loranthus brasiliensis</i>&mdash;the latter a
terrible parasite which quickly envelops the stem and
branches of the tree and ends by killing it.</p>

<p>The collection of the berries is the busiest process
in the fazendas, and has to be performed with considerable
care, for some of the berries are already ripe
and dried when others hidden under the branches have
not yet reached the required degree of maturity. An
experienced hand can collect from 400 to 450 litres
of coffee berries per day. It takes an average of 100
litres of coffee berries to produce 15 kilos of prepared
coffee beans ready to be shipped. The crop is not
the same every year. After one plentiful crop there
generally succeeds one year, sometimes two or three, of
poor&mdash;almost insignificant&mdash;collections, varying according
to the care that is taken of the trees and the soil.</p>

<p>When once the coffee has been collected and transported
to the fazenda in baskets, blankets and sheets,
it is necessary to remove the skin and viscous pulpy
matter which envelop the beans. This is done partly
by maceration in water tanks, and afterwards by drying
upon extensive flat terraces, tiled or cemented, and
locally called <i>terreiro</i>. The process of drying by
machinery has not been adopted in Brazil; principally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-34" id="Pg_1-34"></a>[<a href="./images/1-34.png">34</a>]</span>
because of its high cost. The coffee is first placed for
some days in mounds on the terraces, until fermentation
of the outer skin begins, which afterwards hastens
desiccation when coffee is spread flat in a thin layer
on the terraces. When once the coffee berries have
been freed from their pulpy envelope and skin, the
desiccation&mdash;if the weather is propitious&mdash;takes place
in a few days. Care must be taken to move the berries
constantly, so that they dry evenly on all sides, as
perfect desiccation is necessary in order to preserve
the coffee in good condition after it is packed for shipment.</p>

<p>There are two ways of preparing coffee for export&mdash;the
humid and the dry. In the humid process
the berries are placed in a special machine called
<i>despolpadore</i>, which leaves the beans merely covered
and held together in couples by the membrane immediately
enclosing them after the skin and viscous sugary
coating have been removed. Those coffees are called
in commerce, <i>lavados</i>, or washed.</p>

<p>The dry process consists, after the berries have been
skinned and dried, in removing part of the pulp and
membrane in a special machine and a series of ventilators.
They are then quite ready for export.</p>

<p>The preparation of coffee from the drying terraces
is slightly more complicated. The coffee passes through
a first ventilator, which frees it from impurities such
as earth, stems, stones, filaments, etc.; from this it is
conveyed by means of an elevator into the <i>descascador</i>,
where the membrane is removed. Subsequently it
passes through a series of other ventilators, which
eliminate whatever impurities have remained and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-35" id="Pg_1-35"></a>[<a href="./images/1-35.png">35</a>]</span>
convey the coffee into a polishing machine (<i>brunidor</i>).
There the coffee is subjected to violent friction, which
not only removes the last atoms of impurity but gives
the beans a finishing polish. The coffee is then ready
for the market.</p>

<p>I spent a most instructive day inspecting the fazenda
of Conselheiro Antonio Prado and having things clearly
explained by his intelligent overseer, Mr. Henrique P.
Ribeiro.</p>

<p>From that place I drove across country, through
endless groves of coffee trees&mdash;for miles and miles&mdash;as
far as the next great coffee estate, belonging to the
Dumont Company, an English concern, with an authorized
capital of &pound;800,000, the estates being valued at
&pound;1,200,000. It is not often one sees an estate so
beautifully managed and looked after in a country
like Brazil. The buildings, the machinery, the "drying
terraces," everything was in capital order. To indicate
on what scale the Company does business, it will be
sufficient to state that in 1911 the coffee crop amounted
to 109,368 cwts., which realized on a gross average
56<i>s.</i> 10&frac12;<i>d.</i> per cwt. This crop was not as plentiful as
in the previous year, when 110,558 cwts. were harvested.
The gross profit for the year up to June 21st,
1911, was &pound;123,811 2<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>, which, less London charges,
still showed the substantial sum of &pound;119,387 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
There had been a considerable rise in the rate at which
coffee was sold in 1911&mdash;viz., 56<i>s.</i> 10&frac12;<i>d.</i> per cwt. as
compared with 41<i>s.</i> 8&frac12;<i>d.</i> the previous year; but notwithstanding
the high price, the high rate of exchange,
and the cost of laying the coffee down in London&mdash;which
had risen on the estate by 1<i>s.</i> 11&frac12;<i>d.</i> and by 1<i>s.</i> 3&frac12;<i>d.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-36" id="Pg_1-36"></a>[<a href="./images/1-36.png">36</a>]</span>
in respect of charges between the estate and London,
the Company had been able to earn a profit of 20<i>s.</i> 4&frac34;<i>d.</i>
per cwt.</p>

<p>I was taken round the estate by Mr. J. A. Davy,
the general manager, whose good and sensible work
was noticeable at every turn. The trees seemed in
excellent condition and likely to have a long life on
the specially suitable rich red soil, and with sufficient
breathing space allowed to maintain them in good
health. The soil was of such unusual richness in that
particular spot that no artificial stimulation was required
in order to keep the trees healthy and vigorous.
One could walk for miles and miles along the beautiful
groves of coffee trees, clean-looking with their rich
deep green foliage.</p>

<p>They seemed to have no great difficulty on the
Dumont estate in obtaining sufficient labour&mdash;greatly,
I think, owing to the fair way in which labourers were
treated. Mr. Davy told me that over an area of 13,261
acres a crop had been maintained which averaged
8&frac14; cwts. per acre.</p>

<p>Experiments have also been made on the Dumont
Estate (at an elevation of 2,100 ft. above the sea level)&mdash;chiefly,
I believe, to satisfy the wish of shareholders in
London&mdash;in the cultivation of rubber, but it did not
prove a success&mdash;as was, after all, to be expected. It
is not easy to make the majority of people understand
that coffee grows lustily in that particular part of the
State of S&atilde;o Paulo mainly because of the eminently
suitable quality of the soil; but it does not at all
follow that soil or climatic conditions which are good
for coffee are suitable for rubber trees, or vice versa.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-37" id="Pg_1-37"></a>[<a href="./images/1-37.png">37</a>]</span>
In the case of the Dumont Estates, although the best
possible land was chosen and three different varieties
of rubber&mdash;the Par&aacute;, Cear&aacute; and the Castilloa were
experimented with, it was soon discovered that only
one kind&mdash;the Cear&aacute;&mdash;attained any growth at all, and
this gave very little latex&mdash;owing undoubtedly to the
nature of the soil and the climate. The cost of extracting
the latex was prohibitive. With wages at
four shillings a day a man could collect about one-third
of a pound of latex a day. Rubber trees could,
in that region, not be expected to produce more than
one-fifth of a pound of rubber a year, so that the cost
of collecting and shipping rubber from ten-year-old
trees would amount to 3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per lb., without counting
the cost of planting and upkeep.</p>

<p>By a special train on the Dumont Railway line I
travelled across beautiful country&mdash;all coffee plantations&mdash;the
property of the Dumont Company and of
Colonel Schmidt, the "Coffee King," whose magnificent
estate lies along the Dumont Railway line. I
regretted that I could not visit this great estate also,
but I was most anxious to get on with my journey and
get away as soon as possible from civilization. It was
pleasant to see that no rivalry existed between the
various larger estates, and I learnt that the Dumont
Railway actually carried&mdash;for a consideration, naturally&mdash;all
the coffee from the Schmidt Estate to the
Riber&atilde;o Preto station on the Mogyana Railway.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On the Mogyana Railway</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">I arrived</span> at Riber&atilde;o Preto at 3.45 p.m. on March 29th.
Riber&atilde;o Preto&mdash;421 kil. N.N.W. of S&atilde;o Paulo and 500
kil. from Santos&mdash;is without doubt the most important
commercial centre in the northern part of the State of
S&atilde;o Paulo, and is a handsome active city, neat and
clean-looking, with an Italian, Spanish and Portuguese
population of some 25,000 souls. Its elevation above
the sea level is 1,950 ft. The people of Riber&atilde;o Preto
subsist chiefly on the coffee industry. There are one
or two theatres in the city, the principal being a provincial
one. There are several hotels of various degrees
of cleanliness and several industrial establishments.
Unlike other cities of the interior, Riber&atilde;o Preto boasts
of a good supply of <i>agua potavel</i> (drinking water),
and the town is lighted by the electric light.</p>

<p>The value of land in the vicinity of Riber&atilde;o Preto
varies from 300 milreis to 1,500 milreis for the <i>alqueire</i>,
a price far superior to that of other localities on the
same line, where cultivated land can be purchased at
300 milreis an <i>alqueire</i> and pasture land at 100 milreis.</p>

<p>At Riber&atilde;o Preto I was to leave the Dumont Railway.
Special arrangements had been made for me to
meet at that station a special Administration car which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-39" id="Pg_1-39"></a>[<a href="./images/1-39.png">39</a>]</span>
was to be attached to the ordinary express train on
the Mogyana Railway line.</p>

<p>I had been warned at the Dumont Estate that a
brass band had been sent to the Riber&atilde;o Preto station,
where some notabilities were awaiting my arrival in
order to greet me with the usual speeches of welcome.
As I particularly dislike public speaking and publicity,
I managed to mix unseen among the crowd&mdash;they
expecting to see an explorer fully armed and in khaki
clothes of special cut as represented in illustrated
papers. It was with some relief that I saw them departing,
with disappointed faces, and with their brass
instruments, big drums and all, after they had entered
the luxurious special car placed at my disposal by the
Mogyana Railway and found it empty&mdash;I humbly
watching the proceedings some distance away from the
platform.</p>

<p>Thanks to the splendid arrangements which had
been made for me by Dr. Jos&eacute; Pereira Rebon&ccedil;as, the
President of the Mogyana, I was able to take a most
instructive journey on that line, the Traffic Superintendent,
Mr. Vicente Bittencourt, having been instructed
to accompany me and furnish all possible information.</p>

<p>A few words of praise are justly due to the Mogyana
line for the excellence of the service and the perfection
of the rolling stock. I inspected the entire train and
was amazed to find such beautiful and comfortable
carriages, provided with the latest improvements for
passengers of all classes. It is seldom I have seen in
any country a train look so "smart" as the one in
which I travelled from Riber&atilde;o Preto to the terminus
of the line. The appointments of every kind were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-40" id="Pg_1-40"></a>[<a href="./images/1-40.png">40</a>]</span>
perfect, the train ran in excellent time, and very
smoothly over well-laid rails. The special car in which
I travelled was "palatial and replete with every comfort,"
if I may use the stock words invariably applied
to railway travelling.</p>

<p>Here are a few interesting points regarding the
Mogyana Railway.</p>

<p>By a provincial law (S&atilde;o Paulo) of March 21st,
1872, a guaranteed interest of 7 per cent on a capital
of 3,000,000 milreis was granted for ninety years
for the construction of a railway of 1 metre gauge
from Campinas to Mogymirim, and of a branch line
to Amparo, to the north-east of Campinas and due east
of Inguary. By a similar law of March 20th, 1875, a
guaranteed interest was granted for thirty years as
to the capital of 2,500,000 milreis for a prolongation
of the line to Casa Blanca.</p>

<p>By a provincial law (Minas Geraes) of October 1st,
1881, another guarantee was granted of 7 per cent for
thirty years, upon a maximum capital of 5,000,000
milreis, for a continuation of the railway through the
provincial territory from the right bank of the Rio
Grande to the left bank of the Paranahyba River.
Finally, by a provincial contract of Minas Geraes of
October, 1884, a further guarantee was granted of
7 per cent for thirty years, on a maximum capital of
5,000,000 milreis, for the construction of the prolongation
of the railway from its terminal point at the
Rio Grande as far as the Paranahyba via the city of
Uberaba.</p>

<p>In view of other important concessions obtained,
one may consider that the Mogyana Company is perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-41" id="Pg_1-41"></a>[<a href="./images/1-41.png">41</a>]</span>
the most important railway concern in Brazil, up to
the present time. It does great credit to Brazilians
that the railway was constructed almost entirely by
capital raised on bonds in Brazil itself, the only foreign
loan issued in London being a sum raised amounting
merely to &pound;341,000 at an interest of 5 per cent. Between
the years 1879 and 1886 the Company returned to the
Government of S&atilde;o Paulo the interests received, thus
liquidating its debt. A decree of October 18th, 1890,
fixed the capital spent on the Rio Grande line and
a branch to Caldas at 4,300,000 milreis gold and
1,853,857.750 milreis paper as guarantee of the interest
of 6 per cent conceded by the National Treasury.</p>

<p>In the year 1900 the value of interests received
amounted to 3,190,520.418 milreis in paper, and
1,963,787.300 milreis in gold, out of which 544,787.300
milreis were in debenture bonds. On the same date
the value of interests repaid to the National Treasury
amounted to 1,606,578.581 milreis in paper currency.</p>

<p>The federalized lines of the Company were: from
Riber&atilde;o Preto to Rio Grande (concession of 1883);
from Rio Grande to Araguary (concession of 1890);
with a total extension of 472 kil., and a branch line
from Cascavel to Po&ccedil;o de Caldas, 77 kil., the last 17 kil.
of which were in the Province of Minas Geraes. The
extension from Rio Grande to Araguary, 282 kil., was
also situated in the Province of Minas Geraes.</p>

<p>Having dodged the expectant crowd at the station
unnoticed, I did not go with the Traffic Superintendent,
Mr. Vicente Bittencourt, into the luxurious special car
as the train was steaming out of the Riber&atilde;o Preto
station, but preferred to travel in front of the engine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-42" id="Pg_1-42"></a>[<a href="./images/1-42.png">42</a>]</span>
so as to get a full view of the beautiful scenery along
the line. We went at a good speed over gentle curves
rounding hill-sides, the grass of which bent under a
light breeze. Here and there stood a minute white
cottage&mdash;almost toy-like&mdash;where coffee gatherers lived.
On the left we had a grandiose undulating region&mdash;what
the Americans would call "rolling country"&mdash;combed
into thousands of parallel lines of coffee
trees, interrupted at intervals by extensive stretches
of light green grazing land. Only now and then, as
the engine puffed and throbbed under me, did I notice
a rectangle of dried brownish yellow, where the farmers
had grown their Indian corn. These patches were a
great contrast to the interminable mass of rich dark
green of the coffee trees and the light green of the
prairies.</p>

<p>Near these patches&mdash;prominently noticeable in the
landscape because so scarce&mdash;one invariably saw groups
of low whitewashed or red-painted houses, mere humble
sheds. Where the land was not yet under cultivation&mdash;quite
a lot of it&mdash;low scrub and stunted trees far
apart dotted the landscape.</p>

<p>On nearing villages, as the express dashed through,
goats stampeded in all directions: sleepy women and
men looked at the train half dazed as it went by, and
children, with quite a characteristic gesture, screened
their eyes with their elbows to protect them from the
dust and wind the train produced. I was astonished
to notice how many fair-haired children one saw&mdash;curious
indeed in a population of Latin races and negroes.
That golden hair, however, seemed gradually to grow
darker, and became almost black in the older people.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-43" id="Pg_1-43"></a>[<a href="./images/1-43.png">43</a>]</span>
Hideous barbed-wire fences gave a certain air of
civilization to those parts, but the landscape was nevertheless
getting desolate as we proceeded farther north.
Except in the immediate vicinity of habitations, one
felt the absolute lack of animal life. Only rarely did
we see a black bird of extraordinary elongated form
dash frightened across the railway line, much too fast
for me to identify to which family it belonged.</p>

<p>One could not help being impressed by the immensity
of the landscape, endless sweeping undulation after
undulation spreading before us, but not a real mountain
in sight. It was like a solid ocean of magnified proportions.
Just above the horizon-line a large accumulation
of globular clouds of immaculate white intensified
the interesting colour-scheme of greens and yellows
on the earth's surface to its full value by contrast.</p>

<p>The large proportion of cultivated land which had
impressed me so much in the vicinity of Riber&atilde;o Preto
gradually diminished; and at sunset, by the time we
had reached <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Butataes'">Batataes</ins>, only 48 kil. farther on, hardly
any more coffee plantations were visible. Only fields
of short grass spread before us on all sides. An occasional
bunch of trees hiding a humble farmhouse could
be perceived here and there, but no other sign of life
upon the immense, silent, green undulations of symmetric
curves, not unlike enormous waves of the sea.</p>

<p>Farther north upon the Mogyana line, land seemed
to diminish in price considerably. Its quality was not
so good, especially for coffee plantations. At Batataes,
for instance, 548 kil. by rail from the coast, prices were
cheaper. Good land for cultivation could be obtained
at 200 milreis, and campos at 25 milreis an alqueire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-44" id="Pg_1-44"></a>[<a href="./images/1-44.png">44</a>]</span>
Such low prices were general north of Riber&atilde;o
Preto, although naturally they were likely to increase
as the country got slowly opened up with new roads
and railroads. Away from the railway the price of
land was much lower.</p>

<p>One thing that particularly struck the traveller
straying in those parts was the poverty of all the minor
towns and villages. The industrial development of the
larger settlements consisted merely of a distillery of
"fire-water" (<i>aguardente</i>), or, if the city were modern
and up-to-date, of a brewery, the only two profitable
industries in those regions.</p>

<p><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Batateas'">Batataes</ins>&mdash;according to Brazilian statistics&mdash;was
stated to "<i>deve ter</i>"&mdash;"it should have perhaps" some
5,000 inhabitants. The zone around it was said to be
suitable for coffee growing; in fact, the municipality
possessed much machinery for the preparation of coffee.</p>

<p>At 7.50 p.m. punctually&mdash;as she was due&mdash;the
engine steamed into the Franca station, where the train
was to halt for the night. The passenger traffic was
not yet sufficiently extensive on that line to allow trains
to travel continuously during the twenty-four hours.
Passenger trains ran only in the daytime.</p>

<p>I was treated with the greatest consideration while
travelling on the Mogyana. Not only was the Administration
saloon car, containing a comfortable bedroom,
placed at my disposal, but telegrams had been sent all
along the line with orders to supply me with anything
I required. At Franca, much to my surprise, I found
an imposing dinner of sixteen courses waiting for me
in the station hotel&mdash;with repeated apologies that they
were distressed they could not produce more, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-45" id="Pg_1-45"></a>[<a href="./images/1-45.png">45</a>]</span>
telegram announcing my arrival had been received late.
On no account whatever was I allowed&mdash;as I wished&mdash;to
pay for anything. I was rather interested to watch
in the station restaurant the wonderful mixture of
people who had assembled: priests, monks, railway
porters, commercial travellers&mdash;some black, some white,
some a combination of the two&mdash;all sitting together in
a jovial manner sipping coffee or devouring a meal.</p>

<p>The city of Franca itself, 2 kil. away from the
station, 617 kil. from the sea at Santos, 528 kil. from
S&atilde;o Paulo, was in the most remote northerly corner
of the State of S&atilde;o Paulo, and had a population of 9,000
people or thereabout. The electric light had been
installed in the town, and there was a theatre. Much
difficulty was experienced in obtaining sufficient water
for the needs of the population. In the municipality
there existed a number of machines for use in the rice
and the coffee culture, as well as two steam saws, a
butter, and a sugar factory.</p>

<p>There were several trails&mdash;so-called roads&mdash;branching
off from this town and leading to Borda de Matta,
Garimpo das Canoas, Potrocinio do Sapucahy, S. Jos&eacute;
da Bella Vista, etc.</p>

<p>The climate was healthy and delightful. While I
was there the Fahrenheit thermometer registered 76&deg; at
an elevation of 3,450 feet. With a fairly good soil, the
municipality could produce cereals in plenty under
proper cultivation. Land was cheap enough in that
region&mdash;150 milreis per alqueire for good land for cultivation,
and 25 to 30 milreis per alqueire for campos.</p>

<p>We proceeded on our journey north the next
morning, passing through Indaya, 3,450 ft. above the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-46" id="Pg_1-46"></a>[<a href="./images/1-46.png">46</a>]</span>
sea level&mdash;a settlement boasting of two houses upon
the highest point of the railway line in the State of
S&atilde;o Paulo. We were nearing the Rio Grande, or Great
River, which, flowing in a westerly direction, formed
in that region the northern boundary of the State of
S&atilde;o Paulo with the State of Minas Geraes. As we got
near the river a greater lack of cultivation was noticeable,
with more extensive zones of wooded country,
especially in the depressions of the land. The undulations
of the landscape were more accentuated as we
approached the Minas Geraes province. Clouds hung
low in the valleys, and we occasionally went through
banks of mist not unlike those of Scotland. At
Chapad&atilde;o the ground was more "<i>accident&eacute;</i>"&mdash;to use
an appropriate French expression&mdash;with deep depressions
and indentations in the surface soil caused by
erosion.</p>

<p>The high land on which we had been travelling between
Franca and Iga&ccedil;aba, the station after Chapad&atilde;o,
gave birth on the west to several important tributaries
of the Rio Grande, enumerated below, from south to
north; the Rio Salgado, the Rio do Carmo, Riber&atilde;o
Ponte Nova, Rib. Bandeira, Rio da Soledade, Rib.
S. Pedro; on the east was the Rib. S. Jesus, also a
tributary of the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>As the train sped down the incline towards the Rio
Grande we were now treated to magnificent scenery on
our right. An isolated hill stood at the bottom of
the valley with higher mountains on either side of it,
and, beyond, a high flat-topped plateau. The railway
line skirted snake-like along the hill-side. The hill-tops
were getting more rounded and fairly thickly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-47" id="Pg_1-47"></a>[<a href="./images/1-47.png">47</a>]</span>
wooded. As we got to a lower elevation the isolated
hill assumed the appearance of an elephant's back. A
grassy valley several miles wide opened up before us.</p>

<p>At Rifaina Station we had reached the level of the
banks of the Rio Grande, that is to say, 1,950 ft. above
the sea level. The valley of the river was formed, in
this case also, by erosion which had left isolated hills
in terraces, one with as many as six distinct terraces,
others with rounded backs, but all plainly showing in
their stratification, which was identical with that of
the surrounding elevations, that in former days there
stood, where the valley was now, a plateau which had
subsequently been gradually eroded by the action of
water and wind.</p>

<p>Having crossed the river, we arrived at Jaguara&mdash;we
were now travelling in the Minas Geraes Province&mdash;where
a breakfast awaited us of rice, pork, dried
beef, as hard as leather, omelette with shrimps (a much
cherished dish in those parts), beans, mandioca, and
coffee. Black railway porters, firemen and engine
drivers all sat round the table and ate heartily, the
meal costing 2 milreis, or about 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>The railway ran almost parallel with the river on
the north side round the immense curve which the Rio
Grande describes in that particular section. We passed
Sacramento (elev. 1,850 ft.), and, in numerous curves,
the railway rose by a gradient of 3&frac12; per cent among
hills seemingly worn out by torrential rains into
rounded shapes with huge gaps between. We left the
Rio Grande, there about 100 yards wide with thickly
wooded banks and islands. At Conquista we had
already again reached an elevation of 2,350 ft., but we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-48" id="Pg_1-48"></a>[<a href="./images/1-48.png">48</a>]</span>
still continued to rise by a gradient of 2&frac12; to 3 per cent,
until a pass was reached from which two exquisite
panoramas were obtained. One, particularly interesting,
looked over Conquista with its whitewashed houses&mdash;some
250 of them&mdash;and red-tiled roofs against the
background formed by the rugged sides of the natural
cauldron worn in the tableland by erosion.</p>

<p>At 538 kil., 2,700 ft. above the sea level, a view was
obtained of a small coffee plantation, but most of the
country around was scantily wooded, grassy in places,
barren in others.</p>

<p>The railway, having descended to 2,500 ft., rose
again to 2,900 ft. near Paneiras Station. Then, through
beautiful grazing country, gently undulating, we descended
and mounted and went round sweeping curves,
which formed in places regular loops not unlike a
horseshoe. Two pits producing a considerable quantity
of lime existed some 2 kil. from Paneiras. Weak
attempts were noticeable here and there at growing
coffee. We were now in an eminently wonderful
pasture land&mdash;getting more and more beautiful as we
neared Uberaba, where we found ourselves on almost
flat country at an elevation of 2,900 ft., with hardly
any trees at all and with a delicious climate. The town
of Uberaba, with some 12,000 people, was situated at
a slightly lower elevation&mdash;only 2,700 ft.</p>

<p>Uberaba was perhaps the most important distributing
centre in the western part of Minas Geraes, for
many trails branched from that place to various distant
points in the farther interior. The most important
trail was the one to Sta. Rita do Paranahyba, thence
to the capital of Goyaz Province via Marrinhos and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-49" id="Pg_1-49"></a>[<a href="./images/1-49.png">49</a>]</span>
Allem&atilde;o; whence a second trail went to Fructal via
Concei&ccedil;ao das Alagaos; a third, to Sant' Anna do
Paranahyba, going on the whole almost due west,
but with great deviations, went almost across South
America as far as Pulacayo, in Bolivia, crossing first the
State of Matto Grosso in its southern and narrower
point via Coxim and Corumba, then all Bolivia, eventually
joining the La Paz-Antofagasta Railway line at
Uyum (Pulacayo is connected by rail to Uyum), and
ending at the Pacific Ocean. Another trail led to
Monte Alegre; yet another to Uberabinha&mdash;although
the railway had already connected that town with
Uberaba. This last trail continued, making great
detours, to Bagagem, then to Patrocino, from which
place it deviated due north to Paracat&uacute;, where three
ramifications occurred: one to Sta. Lucia, Pyrinopolis,
and Goyaz (capital); the second to Jamarria, Jocar&eacute;
(on the San Francisco River), and Carrinhan (on the
Carinhaha River, a tributary of the San Francisco),
and eventually by water to the Atlantic Ocean; the
third trail proceeded due east&mdash;across the S. Francisco
River to Montes Claros and Gr&atilde;o Mogol; a fourth in
a south-easterly direction led to Curvelho and Sta.
Lucia, where it met the railway to Rio de Janeiro.
Another route proceeded south to Sta. Rita do Paraiso.</p>

<p>The price of land&mdash;which was excellent in the valley
of the river&mdash;in the vicinity of Uberaba was from 30
to 150 milreis per alqueire&mdash;each alqueire being
reckoned at 10,000 square bra&ccedil;as, and a bra&ccedil;a being
about 6&frac12; ft., or a little over two metres.</p>

<p>After leaving Uberaba the scenery was magnificent,
especially when a storm approached as we were steam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-50" id="Pg_1-50"></a>[<a href="./images/1-50.png">50</a>]</span>ing
over the Serra de Caracol. Dense black clouds
collected and capped the dark green forest of the
Serra, while down, down below on our right the endless
gently undulating plain of fresh green grass was brilliantly
illuminated by a warm dazzling sun. Most
beautiful grazing land&mdash;practically going to waste
now&mdash;we crossed on reaching the highest point of the
Serra; grass, grass, as far as the eye could see&mdash;quite
flat land&mdash;but not a head of cattle in sight; in fact,
no sign of animal life, and a stillness of death except
for the puffing of the railway engine on which I sat.
Water, however, did not seem to abound&mdash;only a small
stream, near which curious-looking patches, or <i>bosquets</i>
of trees lay in dark spots on that light green expanse.
We were then at an elevation of 3,400 ft., amid delightfully
cool and crisp air.</p>

<p>At Burity passed the great route of the cattle
dealers from Goyaz and Matto Grosso for Sta. Rita,
Passos, and Tres Cora&ccedil;&otilde;es do Rio Verde. At Palestina
(845 kil. from the sea) we were on what seemed an
interminable flat plateau with ideally green grass,
and here and there patches of stunted vegetation. Land
could be purchased there as low as 10 milreis an alqueire,
although the best land cost from 50 to 300 milreis.</p>

<p>All was absolutely flat until we reached Sicupira
(elev. 3,100 ft. above the sea level), where we began
to descend to the Rio Uberabinha, its delightfully clear
crystalline water winding its way through scrub.</p>

<p>At Uberabinha we again came across the wonderful
red earth of the Riber&atilde;o Preto district. Situated at
an elevation of 3,050 ft. stood the little town of some
4,000 inhabitants, about 500 yards from the comfort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-51" id="Pg_1-51"></a>[<a href="./images/1-51.png">51</a>]</span>able
and pretty station. Although the land was beautiful,
cultivation could not be said to be prevalent.
Merely some rice, beans, and Indian corn were grown
in small quantities.</p>

<p>From Uberabinha the railway line descended all
the time through thinly wooded country of shrubs and
stunted trees; the verdant prairies, so refreshing to
the eyes, were left behind, and the country became more
broken, but the land was still excellent for agricultural
purposes. After crossing a well-constructed iron bridge
resting on two masonry pillars and spanning the picturesque
rapids of the Rio das Velhas&mdash;the river, with
its turbid, muddy, nasty-looking water, being there
some 80 yards wide, at an elevation of 2,050 ft. above
the sea level&mdash;we again began a steep ascent by a
gradient of over 3 per cent, following most of the time
the river course. The thickly wooded banks obstructed
a good deal of the view except here and there, where a
charming glimpse of the water could be obtained.</p>

<p>Seven hundred and eighty-nine kilometres from
Campinas&mdash;or 982 kil. from the Atlantic Ocean at
Santos&mdash;we arrived at the terminal station of the
Mogyana Railway at a place called Araguary, 3,150 ft.
above the sea level&mdash;one of the dirtiest and most unpleasant
spots on the face of the earth. The termini
of railway lines in newly developed countries seem
to act like filters. Whatever is good passes through;
only the impurities or dregs remain.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Terminus of the Railway&mdash;An Unpleasant Incident&mdash;The Purchase
of Animals&mdash;On the March with the Caravan</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> crowd had assembled at the station. The
train had hardly stopped when my car was invaded
by boisterous people, who embraced me and patted me
on the back in the most approved Brazilian style.
Before I could inquire who they were, one fellow,
more boisterous than the others, informed me that he
had purchased a great many mules for me, that he had
engaged men for me, and also procured riding and pack-saddles,
harness, implements, clothing and bedding for
the men he had engaged, and I do not know what else.
Everything was paid for. I could return the sum paid
out the next day. Another man said he had already
prepared a sumptuous apartment for me in the best
hotel in the town.</p>

<p>When asked who had instructed them to make
such arrangements, they were vague, and on being
pressed for an answer gave names of people of whose
existence I was perfectly ignorant. Before I could
realize what all this meant I discovered&mdash;much to my
annoyance&mdash;that all my baggage had been taken out
of the train and had been conveyed to the hotel. I was
therefore compelled to proceed there myself, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-53" id="Pg_1-53"></a>[<a href="./images/1-53.png">53</a>]</span>
company of my new "friends," who shouted everything
they had to say at the top of their voices, so
that I should not fail to understand. It was already
night, and the streets of the town were in such a
terrible condition that the overladen carriage&mdash;there
were people on all the seats, on the box and standing
on the steps&mdash;nearly turned over on going round
corners. The wheels sank up to their axles in mud.</p>

<p>We pulled up at the hotel door, where another crowd
of loafers had assembled. I was literally dragged into
the hotel&mdash;for I had become somewhat reluctant, first
on seeing the appearance of the place, then on being
met by waves of a nauseating odour which suggested
the non-existence of sanitary arrangements and worse.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in!... wait here!" shouted
they in a most excited manner, when I expressed a
wish to inspect the palatial quarters which they had
been good enough to reserve for me.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment!" shouted the landlord, a
slumbering, disjointed, murderous-looking creature,
whose violent gestures and waving of hands in front
of my face were somewhat irritating. He dashed
into a room on the ground floor&mdash;and we outside could
hear an altercation between the loud-voiced proprietor
and the plaintive moans of a half-dying man.</p>

<p>A moment later the half-dying man, skeleton-like,
with livid eyes, a complexion the colour of a lemon
gone bad, and quivering bare legs, was literally dragged
out of the bed and roughly thrown out of the door.</p>

<p>"Here is your room!" cried the landlord triumphantly
to me, as he flung out of that apartment some
cheap canvas bags, clothes&mdash;which from birth had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-54" id="Pg_1-54"></a>[<a href="./images/1-54.png">54</a>]</span>
been innocent of washing and pressing&mdash;and the socks,
shoes, and day shirt of the guest who had been ejected.</p>

<p>The odour alone, as I peeped into the room, was
enough to stifle any one with the sense of scent even
less delicate than my own. As for the vacant bed&mdash;any
pariah dog of any other country would have been
offended to be offered such filthy accommodation.</p>

<p>In Brazil&mdash;as elsewhere&mdash;it does not do to lose
one's calm. I also wished to avoid an unpleasant
quarrel, as I have a belief that quarrels are bad for
one's health. I spoke gently and kindly to the hotel-keeper,
and said that, although I had ordered nothing,
still, as he had kindly reserved that charming apartment
for me, I should be very pleased to pay for it,
which I would do at once. If he would excuse me, I
preferred to go back to sleep in my private car. Upon
hearing these words a nasty tragi-comic scene occurred,
which, had I not remained cool and collected, might
have ended badly.</p>

<p>"Do you know, sir," shouted the landlord, with
livid features and eyes shooting out of their orbits, so
enraged was he&mdash;"do you know that I am the Chief
of Police here, and that everybody is afraid of me? I
have only to give orders and every one will kill any one
I like." Here he discontinued shaking his somewhat
grimy hands under my nose and, drawing himself up,
stood upon the doorstep of the hotel in order to harangue
the great crowd which had collected.</p>

<p>"We are all millionaires in Brazil," shouted the
landlord, with an effort which seriously impaired the
safety of his fully-congested jugular vein. "We are
all atheists and anarchists in Brazil. Down with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-55" id="Pg_1-55"></a>[<a href="./images/1-55.png">55</a>]</span>
infamous oppression and slavery of Europe! Down
with kings and emperors! Down with Europe, the
land of oppression and cruelty!" And again: "We
in Brazil are the richest people on earth. We are
all millionaires in Brazil. We do not need foreign
charity!"</p>

<p>"Down with foreigners!" answered the chorus of
assembled natives.</p>

<p>The railway inspector who had been sent by the
Company to accompany me became scared at the
turn matters were taking, and told me, against the
instructions he had received, that I could not now
return to the car. Upon hearing this, my new friends,
believing they had me in their power, renewed their
vocal attack.</p>

<p>I remained some time endeavouring to collect my
baggage, pretending to pay no attention whatever to
the absurd oratory. To this day I cannot yet grasp
what the oppression of Europe had to do with my
wanting to pay for something I had never had. I
then repeated my offer, which was again refused.
With the protection of his strong rear-guard, the Chief
of Police advanced bravely towards me, holding in a
suggestive manner with his right hand the pommel of
his revolver in the back pocket of his trousers. In a
tragic manner he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"We will settle this matter, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"We will settle it at once," I placidly replied.</p>

<p>"No, to-morrow," he repeated, with a vicious look.</p>

<p>"Very good: at what time and where?"</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock," he eventually grunted, after I had
repeated the above question four times.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-56" id="Pg_1-56"></a>[<a href="./images/1-56.png">56</a>]</span>
I also politely invited all the others present to come
forward if they had any claims to square. I was quite
ready to settle anybody at any time and anywhere.
Perhaps they might get more than they wished.</p>

<p>I departed with my baggage laden on two carriages
and a cart, and eventually found accommodation at
an equally filthy hotel near the station&mdash;only the latter
place was kept by a humble and honest, decrepit old
woman. I do not know that I have ever spent a more
miserable evening anywhere. I do not mind roughing
it in the roughest way possible, but I have always
detested pretentious efforts at civilization of an inferior
kind. Thus I sat having a meal&mdash;eggs, beans, rice&mdash;all
soaked in <i>toucinho</i> (pork fat) which I detest and
loathe. I watched black railway workmen and
porters stuffing themselves with food in a most unappetizing
way, and making disgusting noises of all
kinds.</p>

<p>Fortunately I remembered that a friend of mine&mdash;a
railway contractor, Mr. Louis Schnoor&mdash;must be at
that time in Araguary, looking after the construction
of the new railway line which will eventually join
Araguary to the capital of Goyaz. I went in search of
him, stumbling along the terrible roads with deep
holes and pools of water and mud. As luck would have
it, I was able to purchase from him, that very same
evening, a number of excellent mules, which he very
generously had offered to place at my disposal without
payment. Also he promised to supply me with two
reliable men&mdash;a job not at all easy in that particular
part of Brazil.</p>

a godsend to me. Thanks to him, I returned
that night quite happy to the miserable hotel. Happy,
because in less than half an hour I had arranged to
leave that pestilential hole the following day. Mr.
Schnoor had kindly undertaken that he would send
me, at eleven o'clock the next morning, in a special
train to the end of the line in construction, some 45 kil.
farther north. In a town of gentle folks like Araguary
the luxury of sleeping with one's window open could
not be indulged in&mdash;especially as nearly all the houses
were one storey high. So the night was rendered
particularly oppressive and long, tormented as you were
in your bed by its innumerable inhabitants, which
stung you all over. I had taken the precaution to
spread a waterproof sheet under my own blankets on
the bed, but that, too, proved ineffective. Mosquitoes
were numerous.</p>

<p>No sanitary arrangements to speak of existed in
Araguary, so that everything was flung out of the
windows into the streets, which made walking about
the town most objectionable. The odour everywhere
was revolting, as can well be imagined. The city
was nevertheless considered by the natives as all that
is most perfect in the way of civilization, for not only
did it possess a few an&aelig;mic electric lights&mdash;so far apart
as to be a nuisance instead of a help in seeing one's
way about&mdash;but also, behold! it actually boasted of
a spasmodic cinematograph. There were some 500
houses, all counted, at Araguary, all more or less
miserable-looking, and a population of some 2,500 souls&mdash;"lost
souls," I should think.</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly came the next morning, March<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-58" id="Pg_1-58"></a>[<a href="./images/1-58.png">58</a>]</span>
31st. At ten o'clock sharp I called on the Chief of
Police at his hotel, and found that he had departed
early in the morning and was not to be expected back
for some hours! A charming way of keeping an
appointment which he was so anxious to bring about.</p>

<p>In the company of Mr. Louis <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Schoor'">Schnoor</ins> I also called
on the persons who said they had made arrangements
for my expedition, as I did not wish to have any misunderstanding
in the matter. Far from having purchased
mules, horses, saddles and harness, they could
produce nothing on demand, and finally asked me to
remain in Araguary for one month&mdash;fancy one month
in Araguary!&mdash;so that they could produce their
purchases.</p>

<p>As I was driving in Mr. Schnoor's carriage we met,
a long way from his home and hotel, the Chief of
Police and hotel proprietor. I immediately dismounted
and informed that gentleman of my visit at the appointed
time. I also demanded that whatever he
wished me to settle must be settled at once.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," said he, shaking me warmly by
the hand. "You owe me nothing. It was all a mistake.
It was all a mistake. Please do not think of
it any more. You owe me nothing, nothing, nothing.
If I can be of use to you, pray order me! I am your
humble servant." And his delightful politeness was
such that I could hardly realize it was the same vicious
man of the previous evening. In my surprise I had
to turn to Mr. Schnoor to inquire whether I had got
hold of the wrong man.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed. Some of those fellows of Central
Brazil were a remarkable mixture of villainy and charm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-59" id="Pg_1-59"></a>[<a href="./images/1-59.png">59</a>]</span>&mdash;in
chemical language one might describe them as
sublimates of rascality and delightful manners.</p>

<p>However, good manners or not, I had taken such
a dislike to the place that I was glad when eleven
o'clock came and Mr. Schnoor conveyed me to the
special train&mdash;an engine and one car. I inspected the
new station of the Goyaz railway, which was already
finished&mdash;a useful, well-constructed building, quite sufficient
for its needs. In the company of Mr. Schnoor,
his chief engineer, Mr. Schirmer and Mr. Bertoux, we
left Araguary&mdash;oh, what a relief!&mdash;for the end of the
line, 45 kil. away. I had decided to go and wait there
in the open country the few hours which would be
necessary to collect the men who were to accompany
me, and the mules.</p>

<p>The work on that portion of the Goyaz line which
was already laid was well and quickly done. Mr.
Schnoor assured me that in four or five months more
they expected to run trains to Catal&atilde;o. An iron
bridge will eventually be built across the Paranahyba
River, within a short distance of which the line had
already been laid when I was there. Some delay had
been experienced in making a deep cut on the south
side of Paranahyba Hills, where the strata had been
found much harder than expected.</p>

<p>I camped for a day and a half at Morro da Meza,
a lovely spot at an elevation of 2,850 ft., from whence
an immense panorama could be enjoyed. What a
relief this heavenly place was after Araguary, and how
everlastingly grateful I shall be to my friend Mr.
Schnoor for having deposited me there!</p>

<p>I took the opportunity of the solitude to rearrange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-60" id="Pg_1-60"></a>[<a href="./images/1-60.png">60</a>]</span>
my baggage. On April 1st my good friend Schnoor
reappeared to see that all arrangements were satisfactory
for my departure.</p>

<p>Morro da Meza will ever remain present in my mind,
for it was my jumping-off place into the wilds. It was
from there that the actual marching on horseback
and on foot began, and it was there I last saw a railway
train for the best part of a year.</p>

<p>On April 1st, at 4 p.m., I left Morro da Meza, went
through the new railway cut in preparation, crossed
the Paranahyba River (at an elevation of 1,970 ft.
above the sea level), and made my camp on the opposite
side of the stream at Anh&atilde;nguera (elev. 2,100 ft.
above sea level) in the railway engineers' camp, 800
yards away from the water. The engineers, an Italian,
Mr. Schnoor's father-in-law, and a Russian&mdash;a Mr.
Martens&mdash;showed me every possible civility. A curious
incident occurred while we were having dinner. The
day was a holiday, and the workmen on the line were
resting. We were sipping our coffee, when a man
entered our hut and said a companion of his had been
shot. We rushed to see him, and we found that the
poor wretch had had his skin perforated in eight
different places by the same bullet. What was more
remarkable was that each perforation was close to
dangerous places in the man's anatomy, and yet not
a single wound was mortal. This is how it happened.
The man was lying down in his suspended hammock,
resting his left hand on his left knee. A friend came
along to show him a new automatic pistol he had
purchased. In the usual silly fashion he had pointed
it at his friend. The pistol went off, and the bullet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-61" id="Pg_1-61"></a>[<a href="./images/1-61.png">61</a>]</span>
passed just under the skin at the knee, at the side of
the knee-cap, and having come out again, went right
through the soft part of the hand between the thumb
and index finger. It then perforated the arm at the
biceps, and further entering the chest, shaved the
heart and came out at the shoulder-blade, continuing
its flight beyond to somewhere where no one could
find it again. That spoke highly for the penetrating
power of bullets from automatic pistols, and also for the
little harm those little bullets may inflict. The man, after
we had carefully dressed his wounds, looked, perhaps,
a little miserable, but he was able to depart on horseback
carrying with his good arm a bottle of medicine.</p>

<p>The Goyaz railway was making rapid progress.
The rails were soon to be laid on the north side of the
river as far as Catal&atilde;o. The bed of the railway was
fast being made ready.</p>

<p>It was not until April 3rd that I was able actually
to make a start with my caravan. My good friend,
Mr. Louis Schnoor, had promised me two men&mdash;Alcides
Ferreiro dos Santos and Filippe da Costa de
Britto; the first a German Brazilian of a violent revolutionary
temper but of extraordinary bravery; the
other a pure negro of a boisterous, simple nature, also
of indisputable bravery in moments of great danger.
These two men&mdash;both natives of Araguary&mdash;proved
themselves to be on that fateful expedition the two
best men I possessed. Thus, if nothing else can be
said in praise of Araguary, it must be said in justice
that it can produce some men of great courage and
faithfulness&mdash;a boast which cannot well be applied to
many places in Brazil.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-62" id="Pg_1-62"></a>[<a href="./images/1-62.png">62</a>]</span>
On April 3rd, at 9 a.m., after a touching farewell,
I left the engineers' camp mounted on a magnificent
mule that Mr. Schnoor had insisted on lending me as
far as Goyaz, with the pack animals which I had
purchased. I did not follow the principal road, which
went by a somewhat circuitous route from Araguary
to the capital of Goyaz via the towns of Catal&atilde;o and
Bomfin, but preferred to travel across country by a
short cut which took you there in an almost direct
line in a north-westerly direction. On getting over
the Serrinha (elev. 2,250 ft.), a hill range, one obtained
a gorgeous view of the valley of the Paranahyba River&mdash;a
river which, already of good width there, became
eventually the great Parana. It is on the right bank
of the river, near its mouth, some thousands of miles
from where we were, that Buenos Aires is situated.</p>

<p>Going through a beautiful forest in undulating
country, we reached the summit of a flat-topped tableland,
2,500 ft. above the sea level, with a gentle slope
towards the north, where the edge of its summit was
some 50 ft. lower than on the south. The vegetation
was somewhat stunted, but interesting, for many were
the trees I noticed which could be put to some use
or other. The Barbatim&atilde;o (<i>Stryphnodendron bar.</i> M.)
was plentiful, and could be used advantageously in
tanning leather; the Pao ferro (<i>C&aelig;salpinia ferria</i> M.)
and the Paneira, were present in quantities.</p>

<p>Through the forest we descended in three hours to
the Rio Virissimo, which, swollen by the sub-tributaries
Barrocas, Indaica, Pirahitinga and Perobas on the
east and Vae Vem on the west, throws itself into the
Paranatinga between Morro Alto and Porto do Barreiro.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-63" id="Pg_1-63"></a>[<a href="./images/1-63.png">63</a>]</span>
That stream had been bridged over. We had descended
to 2,000 ft. During the entire distance&mdash;we had
travelled some 23 kil. from the Paranahyba River&mdash;we
had passed only two miserable sheds and we had not
met a single soul, barring a glimpse at a shaggy female
who happened to be opening the door of her hut as we
were passing, and with a yell of terror banged it again,
and bolted it as she perceived us riding by.</p>

<p>A peculiar kind of wild fig-tree was to be seen, ball-like
in appearance, with branches inclined down instead
of skyward like most trees. On our right as we
proceeded down to the farms of S. Jeronymo and Sta.
Barbara (elev. 2,400 ft.) stood a mountain with
beautiful grazing land upon its slopes. Healthy fat
cattle, in most wonderful condition&mdash;testifying to the
excellence of the grazing in that region&mdash;were bred by
the farmers. To the north, north-east and north-west
behind this place were to be seen delightful green
round-topped hills, also with excellent grazing. A
few cows and imported zebus were to be seen, it is
true, but the country could support a million times that
number and more.</p>

<p>It was that evening that I noticed for the first time
in Brazil a peculiar and most wonderful effect of light
at sunset&mdash;not unlike an aurora borealis. White,
well-defined radiations shot skyward from the west,
where the sun had set, and stood out luminously against
the dark blue sky, like the spokes of a gigantic wheel.
This effect, as we shall see, was repeated frequently at
sunset, and sometimes was even more beautiful than
on the occasion of that first acquaintance with it.</p>

<p>We marched 39&frac12; kil. that day&mdash;with my nine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-64" id="Pg_1-64"></a>[<a href="./images/1-64.png">64</a>]</span>
pack-mules, Formosa (which in Portuguese means
"beautiful"), the splendid white mule I rode, and
three other mules ridden by my men. It was a real
pleasure to see the appetite of the animals when we
made camp. How joyfully they ground with their
powerful jaws the Indian corn which each had received
in a nose-bag soon after we had halted, removed the
loads and saddles from their backs, and properly
groomed them!</p>

<p>When we started the next morning we went through
most beautiful grazing land for some 20 kil., and
through marvellous grassy slopes on the mountains
beyond. Streamlets of clear abundant water were
passed. From 2,050 ft., the elevation of the stream,
we rose to 2,650 ft., then descended gradually to the
village of Corumbahyba, with its brand-new red-tiled
roofs and whitewashed houses&mdash;very tiny, and, with
one exception, all one-storied. The windows and
doors were gaily decorated with bright blue paint.
There was a church, of course, on one side of the large
square smothered in high grass, and by the church two
wooden pillars supported a beam from which hung a
bronze bell. Then in the centre of the square stood,
most prominent of all in the village, a huge wooden
cross in a dilapidated condition. What little life
seemed to exist in the place was to be found in the
local store, where an inquisitive crowd had collected
when I arrived.</p>

<hr />
<p>My mules were let loose to graze in the square,
joining a number of cows that were there already. As I
sat in the shop, closely examined by the inhabitants,
I returned the compliment by analysing them. What a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-65" id="Pg_1-65"></a>[<a href="./images/1-65.png">65</a>]</span>
strange, dried-up, worn-out appearance young and
old presented! What narrow, chicken-like chests,
what long, unstable legs and short arms. And, dear
me! what shaggy, rebellious hair, which stood out
bristle-like in all directions upon their scalps! Yet
those people came from ancestors who must have been,
centuries ago, magnificent types of humanity to be
able to accomplish what they did in the way of colonization.
With the habit we possess of looking for finer,
healthier specimens of humanity in the country than in
the cities, this condition of affairs came somewhat as
a surprise to me, since that rule generally applied to
most nations I have visited except Brazil. Those
people, partly by constant intermarriage among themselves,
partly by the mixture of black blood with the
white, and greatly owing to the effects of the most
terrible complaint of the blood in existence&mdash;universal
in Brazil&mdash;partly, too, by the dull, uninteresting,
wasted lives they led and the poverty of their nourishment,
were reduced to a state of semi-idiocy. The
men hardly seemed to have the strength and energy
to walk or even stand up&mdash;although I must confess, to
my regret, that they had not yet lost the power of
talking.</p>

<p>Their features were unattractive. Eyes wide apart
and widely expanded, so that the entire circle of the
iris was exposed, although the eyeball itself was not
<i>&agrave; fleur de t&ecirc;te</i>, but rather sunk into excessively spacious
orbital cavities in the skull. The part of the eyeball
which is usually white was yellow with them, softened
somewhat by luxuriant eyelashes of abnormal length.
In fact, the only thing that seemed plentiful and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-66" id="Pg_1-66"></a>[<a href="./images/1-66.png">66</a>]</span>
vigorous with them was the hair, which grew abundantly
and luxuriantly everywhere, just as bad grass
and weeds do on uncultivated or abandoned lands.
There was a lot of hair everywhere&mdash;on the scalp, on
the eyebrows, on the men's unshaven cheeks, on the
chest, the arms, hands, and the legs. It is, I believe,
a well-known fact that hair is generally more luxuriant,
the weaker and more an&aelig;mic the subject is&mdash;up to a
certain point.</p>

<p>Deep grooves and hollow cheeks&mdash;the latter due
to absence of teeth&mdash;marked the faces of even young
men. Then one of the most noticeable peculiarities
was the extraordinary development, prominence and
angularity of the apple of the throat. The ears&mdash;which
to my mind show the real character and condition of
health of a person more than any other visible part of
his or her anatomy&mdash;were large and prominent, occasionally
well-formed, but lacking colour and the
delightful, well-chiselled, vigorous curves of healthy,
normal, intelligent people. The hands and feet were
generally small and well-shaped, in wonderful condition&mdash;though
not necessarily clean&mdash;owing to the
inborn reluctance which all the people of Brazil have
towards manual labour.</p>

<p>It has always been my experience that, generally
speaking, malformed people possess distorted brains&mdash;which
does not mean at all that the brain of a malformed
person may not perhaps develop in a marvellous
manner in one particular direction. What I maintain
is that, with few possible exceptions, the brains of
malformed people are seldom perfectly balanced. In
those particular subjects it did not take a deep student<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-67" id="Pg_1-67"></a>[<a href="./images/1-67.png">67</a>]</span>
of human nature to set down the entire crowd of them
as visionaries, most fantastically inclined&mdash;in which
direction, having no restraint whatever, they ran
absolutely amuck.</p>

<p>Yet there was something very charming about the
people of the interior of Brazil, after they had overcome
their first suspicion of strangers and their own shyness.
They seemed imbued with the idea that everybody
went there specially to do them harm. They lived in
a constant state of fear and trembling, even of their
own relations and friends. They all went about armed
to the teeth, and would not dream of going a yard
outside their homes without a revolver, a rifle and a
dagger. Even to walk about the village the men were
all armed.</p>

<p>When not in a rage or sulky&mdash;which seemed to be
their almost constant condition&mdash;they were the most
good-hearted people I have ever met; gentle, affectionate&mdash;in
fact, so sentimental that it became a positive
nuisance. If one learnt how to deal with them&mdash;which
was not always easy&mdash;they were really delightful people
in their enviable simplicity.</p>

<p>A reflection of the people's mentality was to be
discovered at a glance in examining the articles that
were for sale in the only shop in the village. There,
remember, you were in a country which, from an
agricultural point of view, could be made of immense
value. Now, did you notice any implements in the
shop which suggested agricultural pursuits of any kind
whatever? No; what you found were patent leather
dress shoes, elaborately embroidered top-boots, fancy
neckties, gaudy gilt and silver spurs of immense size,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-68" id="Pg_1-68"></a>[<a href="./images/1-68.png">68</a>]</span>
bottles of powerful perfumes, fancy soaps, mirrors,
combs, and highly-coloured calicoes, beer, fire-water,
and other such articles of luxury.</p>

<p>The Corumbahyba village stood at an elevation of
2,250 ft. in a hollow surrounded by low hills. The
water was delicious at that place.</p>

<p>As I was getting through my lunch&mdash;which I enjoyed
thoroughly after my morning march of 23 kil.&mdash;I
saw crossing the square two murderers laden with
iron chains, led along with a rope by two mounted men.
The natives present laughed as they saw the poor devils
struggle along. Not a sign of pity or care was shown
by anybody present.</p>

<p>After leaving Corumbahyba we witnessed a panorama
of magnificent mountain scenery from a height
of 2,550 ft., to which we had ascended. Then came a
steep and rugged descent through a forest down to
a streamlet (2,250 ft.); then up another ascent to
2,350 ft. and down again to 2,050 ft. at the great
Corumb&aacute; River, there 300 yards wide. We crossed this
beautiful stream&mdash;animals and all&mdash;on three canoes
joined together, upon which a platform had been
built.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the river were several picturesque two-wheeled carts
waiting to be ferried across. Drawn by ten, twenty,
and even as many as thirty oxen, these heavy hooded
vehicles travelled across country in a most wonderful
manner. Naturally they had to be of solid construction
to stand the wear and tear demanded of them. Their
wheels were heavy solid discs of hard wood encircled
by powerful tyres of iron. A primitive system of
brake&mdash;a mere bar of wood held in position by ropes&mdash;retarded
the speed of the vehicle down extra-steep
declivities. When going up or down hill the friction
of the wheels upon their axles produced a continuous
shrill whistle, which, when heard from a distance,
sounded not unlike the whistle of a locomotive. In
the deathly stillness of the Goyaz landscape those
whistles could be heard a long way off. The expectant
farmers&mdash;expectant, because those trading carts conveyed
to them a good deal of the food-stuff, salt, and
other necessaries of life, as well as the luxuries they
could afford&mdash;were clever at recognizing the whistles
of the various carts, and they identified one special
cart or another by what they poetically called the
"voice of the wheel" or the "song of Goyaz."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-70" id="Pg_1-70"></a>[<a href="./images/1-70.png">70</a>]</span>
There were some picturesque rapids just above
the spot where we crossed the Corumb&aacute; River, which
flowed in a tortuous channel with a general direction
of W.S.W.</p>

<p>To the east of our track, as we proceeded northward,
stood a glorious range of hills with magnificent
grazing land extending for many miles. In front of
us to the north and N.N.E. towered a high plateau, the
Serra de Callos, also called, I believe, Serra do Cusuzeiro.</p>

<p>Still travelling up and down and across several
streamlets, we reached at sunset the Rio Boccagna
(2,230 ft. above the sea level), which, soon after passing
the place where we crossed it, entered the large river
Bagri, winding its way through a gorgeous forest.
We had passed during the day really wonderful grazing
land on either side of the track, but principally to the
east, between the north bank of the Corumb&aacute; River
and Camp Mazagan. There were plenty of small
streams in the hilly and sometimes slightly wooded
valleys.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock, having ridden that day 76 kil.,
we halted after dark at the <i>moradoria</i>, or farm, of
Mazagan (elev. 2,375 ft. above the sea level). We
were politely asked to enter the house, and immediately
preparations were made to clear out the best room
for me. The illumination was not grand: an ancient
metal arrangement&mdash;not unlike a Pompeian lamp&mdash;with
a wick soaked in oil profusely smoking. In the
dim light I could just distinguish in the background,
reclining against the wall, a youth with a guitar, from
which two chords&mdash;always the same two chords&mdash;were
strummed. The boy seemed in a trance over this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-71" id="Pg_1-71"></a>[<a href="./images/1-71.png">71</a>]</span>
musical composition, and even our appearance had not
disturbed his efforts. He had taken no notice whatever
of us. Dinner was prepared&mdash;it took a long time&mdash;the
musician all the time delighting his admiring family
with the two monotonous chords.</p>

<p>"It is a pity," said his delighted mother to me,
"that we cannot send him to school. He is a genius;
he would astonish the world."</p>

<p>"Yes," I hastily agreed, "it <i>is</i> a pity you cannot
send him ... somewhere!"</p>

<p>"Can you not take him with you?"</p>

<p>I explained to the poor woman that it required
very civilized people to appreciate her son's music.
Among the wild Indians I expected to find, later on
in my journey, I was sure that with music like that,
we should all be killed; they were such savages!</p>

<p>After two solid hours&mdash;and the two chords still
continuing, with no signs whatever of relenting&mdash;I
asked the musical genius if he could treat me to a
different tune. Alas! he knew no other, but as he
saw that I was so fond of music he would again, with the
greatest pleasure, go on playing the same air&mdash;he called
it an air.</p>

<p>"<i>Muito obrigado!</i> (Thank you very much!)" I
moaned, with a sickly smile on my lips and a violent
internal wish to smash guitar and guitarist.</p>

<p>"<i>No hai de que!</i> (Do not mention it!)" and here
recommenced the repetition of the two chords.</p>

<p>"I should like to go to sleep now; thank you
very much again for the lovely music," I next
plaintively added, in my most approved Brazilian
politeness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-72" id="Pg_1-72"></a>[<a href="./images/1-72.png">72</a>]</span>
"Oh, not at all: I shall go on playing while you
are sleeping. It will give you pleasant dreams!"</p>

<p>It was too pathetic. Nothing short of murder could
have stopped his enthusiasm. Being a traveller of
years' experience, I was not to be outwitted. As he
would not stop the music, I stopped hearing it by
stuffing my ears tight with cotton-wool. So I slept
soundly enough, notwithstanding the orchestral entertainment.
At sunrise, when I opened my eyes again,
the boy was still at it. I removed the cotton from my
ears ... yes, indeed, the identical two chords!</p>

<p>The boy and the guitar will perhaps never know
what a narrow escape they both had! In despair I
gave orders to get the mules ready at once in order to
depart immediately.</p>

<p>Those halts in farmhouses were dreary beyond
words. The Brazilians of the interior&mdash;quite unlike
those of the big towns in or near the coast&mdash;were sullen
people, with no conversation&mdash;or else too much&mdash;no
interest in anything, no art, no imagination. They
were timid and vain to an incredible degree, suspicious,
avaricious, and easily offended, so that the greatest
tact had to be used with them. They were ignorant
of everything even in their own immediate neighbourhood.
Yet, mind you, with all that, extraordinarily
kind and ultra-polite of speech. They all seemed
turned out of the same mould. When you had seen
one you had seen them all. There were, of course, a
few exceptions&mdash;Brazilians of recent German, French,
Italian or Spanish origin&mdash;but these exceptions were
indeed very rare in the interior.</p>

<p>Ill-fed, his blood corrupted and impoverished to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-73" id="Pg_1-73"></a>[<a href="./images/1-73.png">73</a>]</span>
utmost degree&mdash;his health, therefore, never in a normal
condition&mdash;his finances at the lowest ebb, the Brazilian
of the interior had little indeed to make him happy.
His home at best was as miserable and dirty as
possible. The room generally given to an honoured
guest&mdash;the best in the house&mdash;was the granary. More
than once was my camp-bed perched on a mound of
Indian corn. And the furniture? A wooden bench
of the roughest description&mdash;really an instrument of
torture rather than an article of comfort; a few wooden
pegs in the wall for hanging rifles or other things; an
occasional wooden bedstead; seldom, very seldom, a
stool or a chair&mdash;in any case, never a comfortable one
such as you invariably find with peasants and old-established
colonists of most other countries. They
cared not for comfort. Their beds, a mass of rags, were
shared by masters and hens and dogs. Everything was
in an abandoned state, everything had fallen to rack
and ruin. All looked as if they were tired of life, too
indolent to move. They seldom saluted when you met
them on the trail, nor when you entered their houses;
if they did, they rapidly touched their dilapidated hats
as if afraid to spoil them. Never did you perceive
a smile upon their long-drawn countenances. When
they greeted one another they laid their bodies close
together as if about to dance the <i>tango</i>, and patted each
other repeatedly on the shoulder-blades, turning their
heads away as if to avoid their reciprocal evil odour.
It is not the fashion in any part of Brazil to shake
hands. Some say it is because of the unpleasant feeling
of touching sweating hands; others suggest that it is
to prevent the contagion of the many skin complaints<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-74" id="Pg_1-74"></a>[<a href="./images/1-74.png">74</a>]</span>
from which people suffer. When they do shake hands&mdash;with
a stranger, for instance&mdash;one might as well be
grasping the very dead hand of a very dead man; it
is done in so heartless a manner.</p>

<p>For a consideration they reluctantly gave a stranger
what little they possessed, but they had not the remotest
idea of the value of things. In one farmhouse
you were charged the equivalent of a few pence for
an egg or a chicken; in the next farm a small fortune
was demanded for similar articles of convenience. Men,
women, children, dogs, pigs and fowls, all lived&mdash;not
happily, but most unhappily&mdash;together.</p>

<p>No sooner were we able to saddle the animals and
pack the baggage and pay our hostess, than we tried
to make our escape from that musical farm. But luck
was hard on me that day. One mule was lost, a second
received a terrible gash in his hind quarters from a
powerful kick from another mule.</p>

<p>We went on among low, fairly grassy hills to the
west, W.N.W. and to the east of us. We still had
before us the Serra de Callos&mdash;a flat-topped tableland
some 12 kil. in diameter on the summit, where it was
almost circular. Its deeply grooved sides showed
clearly the great work of erosion which had occurred
and was still taking place in those regions. With the
exception of two spurs, which projected on the west
and east sides of the plateau, its sky-line was quite
clean and flat.</p>

<p>After rising to an elevation of 2,600 ft., then descending
to 2,450 ft., we crossed two streamlets which
afterwards joined a fairly important torrent. One was
called the Rio Boa Vista. We gradually then rose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-75" id="Pg_1-75"></a>[<a href="./images/1-75.png">75</a>]</span>
to 2,750 ft. on another flat tableland to the east of the
Serra de Callos, with its sides eroded in two distinct
terraces, the higher one being almost a straight wall
from two-thirds up the side of the range. In the lower
portion a number of rounded mounds were to be
observed, which, with a stretch of the imagination
and for the sake of comparison, resembled, perhaps,
elephants' heads.</p>

<p>North-east of the Serra stood a thickly-wooded,
detached mound, while to the north as we went along
there was displayed before us a magnificent view of
the flat valley into which we were about to descend.</p>

<p>Where the country was wooded many trees and plants
were to be found, useful for their tanning, medicinal,
oliferous or lactiferous qualities: such as the Dedal,
a yellowish-leafed shrub from which a yellow dye can
be obtained; the tall thin Arariba Amarelho, or
Amarelhino (<i>Centrolobium robustum</i>), a great number
of Lobelia trees, with their elongated light green leaves
and clean barked stems, which eject, from incisions, a
caustic and poisonous juice. The tallest of all the
trees in that region was perhaps the Jacaranda, with its
tiny leaves.... There were four kinds of Jacaranda&mdash;the
Jacaranda <i>cabiuna</i>, <i>rosa</i>, <i>tan</i> and <i>violeta</i>, technically
known as <i>Dalbergia nigra</i>, <i>Mach&aelig;rium incorruptibile</i>,
<i>Mach&aelig;rium cencopterum</i>, <i>Mach&aelig;rium Alemanni</i>, Benth.
The three latter have a specific gravity higher than
that of most woods in Brazil, except the Pao de
ferro (<i>C&aelig;salpina ferrea</i>), the very plentiful Barbatimao
(<i>Stryphnodendron barbatimao</i>), a mimosa-like tree, and
the Vinhatico amarello (<i>Echyrosperum Balthazarii</i>),
the last of which has the highest specific gravity of all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-76" id="Pg_1-76"></a>[<a href="./images/1-76.png">76</a>]</span>
Then we found plenty of Sambaiba, an excellent
wood, and Imuliana, a wood of great resistance, much
used in certain parts of Brazil for constructing fences.</p>

<p>A peculiar tree with concave leaves shaped like a
cup was locally called Ariticun or Articun. It produced
a large fruit, quite good to eat.</p>

<p>Much botanical variety was indeed everywhere
around us.... There was the <i>terra da folha miuta</i>, which,
as its name tells, possessed minute shiny leaves; then
the tall Faveiro (<i>Pterodon pubescens</i>), producing a bean,
and having dark leaves not unlike those of mimosas.
Then, many were the kinds of acacias we noticed as we
went along.</p>

<p class="fsc">Picturesque Ox-carts of Goyaz.</p>
<hr />
<p>Still descending, we arrived at the little town of
Caldas de Goyaz&mdash;so called because there were three
hot springs of water of different temperatures. I
visited the three springs. The water tasted slightly
of iron, was beautifully clear and quite good to drink.
Two springs were found in a depression some 150 ft.
lower than the village&mdash;viz., at an elevation of 2,450 ft.,
whereas the village itself was at 2,600 ft. These two
springs were only 20 ft. away from a stream of cold
water. A short distance from the cold stream was
another stream of hot water emerging from the rocks.</p>

<p>Small rectangular tanks had been made at the two
higher springs, which were said to possess wonderful
curing qualities for eczema and other cutaneous troubles;
also for rheumatism and blood complaints of all kinds.
Whether those waters were really beneficial or not, it
was not possible to ascertain on a passing visit. I
drank some of the water and it did me no harm, so if
it does no good neither is it injurious.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-77" id="Pg_1-77"></a>[<a href="./images/1-77.png">77</a>]</span>
The village of Caldas showed signs of having seen
better days. It was clean-looking, but like all other
villages of Goyaz it was dreary in the extreme. There
were only a few houses in the place, and each had a
shop; all the shops sold similar articles&mdash;nickel-plated
revolvers, spurs and daggers, calicoes, gaudy wearing-apparel,
perfumery, and so on.</p>

<p>For any one interested in the study of the effects of
erosion on a gigantic scale, no more suitable country
could be found than Central Brazil. Here again to the
E.N.E. of Caldas stood the Serra do Sapp&eacute;. In this
case it was not a tableland, like the Serra de Caldas,
but purely a hill range. The plateau of Serra de
Caldas, I was told, measured on its summit 12 kil.
by 18 kil.</p>

<p>Again, after leaving Caldas, we went through most
wonderful grazing ground to the north-east and east
of our route at the foot of the Serra do Sapp&eacute;. We
had descended to the Rio Lagiadi, 2,480 ft. above the
sea level, which flowed into the Pirapitinga River (a
tributary of the Corumb&aacute;). Once more did we admire
that evening the remarkable effect of solar radiation,
this time a double radiation with one centre&mdash;the sun&mdash;to
the west, and a second centre, at a point diametrically
opposite, to the east. Those radiations, with a
gradually expanded width, rose to the highest point of
the celestial vault, where they met. The effect was
gorgeous indeed, and gave the observer the impression
of being enclosed in the immeasurable interior of an
amazingly beautiful sea-shell turned inside out.</p>

<p>We arrived in the evening at the farm of Laza (elev.
2,450 ft.), where we had to abandon the wounded mule,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-78" id="Pg_1-78"></a>[<a href="./images/1-78.png">78</a>]</span>
and also another which, on coming down a steep incline,
had badly injured its fore leg.</p>

<p>The pack-saddles used in the interior of Brazil
(Minas Geraes, Goyaz and Matto Grosso) were the
most impracticable, torturing arrangements I have
ever had to use on my travels. The natives swore by
them&mdash;it was sufficient for anything to be absurdly unpractical
for them to do so. It only led, as it did
with me at first, to continuous unpleasantness, wearying
discussions and eventual failure if one tried to diverge
from the local habits, or attempted to eradicate deeply-rooted
ideas.</p>

<p>Let me describe a typical Brazilian pack-saddle.
It weighed, with its inseparable protecting hide, well
over 90 lbs. It was bulky and cumbersome, most
difficult to lift and set right on the animal's back. It
consisted of two great parallel, clumsily-carved, heavy
U-shaped pieces of wood supported upright on two
enormous pads, at least double the size and thickness
necessary. The breast and tail pieces were of extra
thick leather of great width, which had the double
disadvantage of being heavy and of producing bad sores
by their constant friction and hard, saw-like, cutting
edges. Then the saddle allowed the loads to hang
much too low on the sides of the animal's body. This
naturally saved trouble and effort to the men who
packed the animals. Two of them simply lifted the
loads simultaneously on the two sides and hooked
them to the saddle by means of adjusted loops of leather
or rope. Then came the difficulty of keeping the loads
in position, so that they would not shift back and
forth. This was done by passing a leather thong over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-79" id="Pg_1-79"></a>[<a href="./images/1-79.png">79</a>]</span>
all and under the animal's belly, which was then
squeezed beyond all measure. Result of this: continuous
trouble to pack rebellious animals, who knew
what was coming; painful marching for the animals,
who thus had difficulty in breathing, and therefore
extra long marches, almost an impossibility without
much injury to them. We will not speak of sore backs,
sore sides, sore chests, and sore tail root&mdash;which was a
matter of course after a pack animal had borne for a
few hours one of those torturing arrangements on its
back.</p>

<p>I had tried to adopt lighter saddles of a more practical
design, such as I had used on other expeditions;
but as this involved a different method altogether of
packing the animals, it led to much derision, unpleasantness,
and refusal to do the work except in their own
stupid way, so that in order to save time, expense and
trouble I had to conform, much against my will, to the
Brazilian method. It was an impossibility to induce
a Brazilian of the interior to agree that any other way
of doing anything was better or even as good as his
own.</p>

<p>A painful phase of human existence, as the country
became more and more sparsely inhabited, was the
number, relative to the population, of cases of sexual
insanity, due naturally to the great difficulty of intercourse.
We will not refer to sexual vices&mdash;extremely
common&mdash;which reduced the few inhabitants to a
state of absolute idiocy. Thus at Laza farm there
were only three women and no men. They were all of
a certain age, and for many many years had been there
alone, and had not seen a man. They had become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-80" id="Pg_1-80"></a>[<a href="./images/1-80.png">80</a>]</span>
absolutely insane, and it required no little tact to prevent
a catastrophe. One&mdash;a repulsive, toothless black
woman, formerly a slave&mdash;was in such an excited state
of mind that I was really glad when I saw my troop
of animals started on the march early the next morning.</p>

<p>On April 6th we were still on the north side of the
Serra de Caldas, at the northernmost point of which
flowed a <i>riber&atilde;o</i>, or great river (elev. 2,450 ft.). Most
beautiful grazing land spread to the north of us, enormous
stretches of undulating country verdant with
delicious grass. The Sapp&eacute; Mountains were still visible
in the distance.</p>

<p>Marching through enchanting country&mdash;almost level,
or merely rising or descending a few feet&mdash;with a magnificent
view of distant mountains to our right and of
low flat plains and far-away tablelands to our left,
we arrived, after a morning's march of 36 kil., at the
fazenda of Pouso Alto (elev. 2,600 ft.).</p>

<p class="fsc">A Clever Automatic Pounding Machine.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outwardly Pouso Alto was by far the neatest-looking
fazenda we had yet seen since leaving Araguary, but
on entering the house the floor was a mass of dirt.
Fowls were running to and fro all over the rooms. A
rough table of Portuguese origin, a couple of benches
so dirty that one did not dare to sit on them, some
roughly made bedsteads, miserable and filthy&mdash;but no
washstands or basins, no articles of necessity were
anywhere to be observed or found. The mattresses&mdash;if
one can elevate them to the dignity of such a name:
they were mere bags filled with anything that had been
found handy, such as the leaves and stalks of Indian-corn,
wool and dried grass&mdash;were rolled up in the
daytime. Only one bed was still made up. On it a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-81" id="Pg_1-81"></a>[<a href="./images/1-81.png">81</a>]</span>
cackling hen was busy laying an egg. That egg&mdash;a very
good egg&mdash;was triumphantly served to me for breakfast.</p>

<p>The walls of nearly all the farmhouses in the southern
part of the Province of Goyaz were made of wooden
lattice work, the square cavities formed by the cross
sticks being filled in and the whole plastered over with
mud, which eventually became hard when dry. Near
the foundations the walls were strengthened with mud
bricks half baked.</p>

<p>Evidently, as was the case with this particular old
house, in former days, when Goyaz was more prosperous
than it is now, in the time of the Emperor, most of the
houses were whitewashed&mdash;a luxury which in these days
of misery the farmers can no longer indulge in. The
doors and windows were rambling, though the frames
of them were generally solidly made, but one never saw
a pane of glass in any window anywhere in the country.
At night the people barricaded themselves tight into
their rooms and let no air in. It was partly due to
fear of attack. Whenever a building was whitewashed
one invariably saw on it the impression of its owner's
spread hand in outline, or else his signature in blue
paint. The favourite colours in house decoration&mdash;where
any were noticeable&mdash;were blue and a dirty
cinnabar red.</p>

<p>Dogs were numerous everywhere, and, like their
masters, were indolent and sleepy.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of that same day we travelled
some 13 kil. more, on practically level ground intersected
by a couple of streamlets. Marching through
thinly wooded country, grassy here and there, one began
to notice a variation in the scenery, which was gradually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-82" id="Pg_1-82"></a>[<a href="./images/1-82.png">82</a>]</span>
becoming more tropical in appearance. Palm trees,
especially burity (<i>Mauritia vinifera</i> M.), in single specimens,
or in groups, could be seen in the great stretches
of good grazing country which appeared on both sides
of our course.</p>

<p>We spent the night at the fazenda of Ritiro Alegre
(elev. 2,450 ft.), which words translated mean "the
merry rest"&mdash;a most undeserved name, I can assure
you, for neither merriment nor rest was to be obtained
there. An evening in a Brazilian farm was, nevertheless,
occasionally not devoid of interest or of comic
scenes.</p>

<p>These folks evidently valued little the life of their
children. As I was sitting on the doorstep waiting
for my dinner to be cooked, down came, galloping at a
breakneck speed and riding bareback, a little child of
eight, carrying slung under his arm a smaller child of
one, the latter squealing terribly. They both landed
safely at the door. Then there appeared one of the
picturesque carts drawn by twelve oxen, anxiously
awaited by the family. Twenty snarling, snorting,
ill-natured pigs provided enough noise seriously to
impair the drums of one's ears; and when you added
to this the monotonous bellowing of cows and oxen,
the frantic neighing of horses and mules waiting to be
fed, the crowing of cocks and the cackling of hens, the
unmusical shrieks of a beautiful <i>arara</i> (or macaw, of
gorgeous green, blue, and yellow plumage), and of
two green parrots&mdash;to which total add, please, the
piercing yells of the children&mdash;it was really enough to
drive one insane.</p>

<p>They were superior farmers, those of the "Merry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-83" id="Pg_1-83"></a>[<a href="./images/1-83.png">83</a>]</span>
Rest"&mdash;no one could doubt it when the lady of the
house and her pretty daughter arrived from an errand
and found strangers in the house. Dear me, what
style, what enchanting affectation, the pretty maid and
her mamma put on when they perceived us!... With
an air of solemnity that was really delightful, they each
offered us the tip of one finger for us to shake, and
spoke with such affectation that their words stumbled
one against the other. Their vocabulary was evidently
restricted, and in order to make the conversation elegant
they interpolated high-sounding words which did not
exactly belong, but sounded grand in their ears. It
was a trial to have to remain serious.</p>

<p>Dinner was served&mdash;always the same fare wherever
you went. Boiled rice (very badly boiled), beans,
stewed chicken chopped up, <i>pimienta</i> (peppers), fried
eggs and Indian corn flour, which one mixed up together
on one's plate and rendered into a paste. The
coffee was always plentiful and good, but so strong
that it was quite bitter.</p>

<p>By the light of a wick burning and smoking terribly
from the neck of an ex-medicine bottle filled with oil,
we enjoyed our meal, watched intently by the entire
family, silent and flattened in semi-obscurity against
the walls. The primitive lamp gave so little light&mdash;although
it gave abundant smell&mdash;that the many figures
were almost indistinguishable against the dirty background,
and all one perceived on raising one's eyes
from the dinner-plate was a row of expanded eyes,
following the movements of our hands, and just under
that row a row of white teeth.</p>

<p>When seen in a stronger light it was curious to notice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-84" id="Pg_1-84"></a>[<a href="./images/1-84.png">84</a>]</span>
criminal characteristics on nearly every face one saw;
in the servants at those farmhouses one frequently
observed murderous-looking creatures whom one would
not care to meet alone in the dark. They were a
special breed of stranded outcasts who had drifted
there&mdash;the outcome of a complex mixture of Portuguese,
former black slaves, and Indians. When you
realized that the people who had drifted into the interior
were the worst Portuguese, the worst blacks, and the
Indians who intermarried with these gentry the worst
Indians, you can well imagine what fine results could
be expected from such a breed.</p>

<p>One trait predominant among these people was the
unreasonable jealousy of the men over their women.
Had they been so many Venuses of Milo the men could
not have guarded them with more ferocity. I am sure
it would take a brave man indeed, and, above all, a
totally blind man, to fall in love with the farmers'
wives, daughters, or servants of the Province of Goyaz.</p>

<p>I must say this in favour of my Brazilian men, that,
whatever other faults they may have had, they always,
behaved in a most chivalrous, dignified way with the
women-folk we met. Never once did I have to reprimand
them.</p>

<p>In the morning, as the cows were driven into the
yard to be milked, and the calves were being suckled
by their mothers, and the children, rubbing their
sleepy eyes with the backs of their hands, scrambled
out of the house upon their drowsy legs, the girls of
the family brought the last cups of coffee to us departing
strangers. We packed our animals, paid the bill, and
were off again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-85" id="Pg_1-85"></a>[<a href="./images/1-85.png">85</a>]</span>
On April 7th we crossed the Piracanjuga River,
another tributary of the Corumb&aacute;, 50 yards wide,
flowing from north-east to south-west, at an elevation
of 2,300 ft. One league (6 kil. 600 m.) farther on we
crossed another stream flowing east, in its turn a tributary
of the Piracanjuga.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful trees in that region was
the <i>caneleira</i>, of the family of the <i>Laurineas</i>. Beautiful,
too, were the <i>oleo pardo</i> and <i>vermelho</i> (<i>Myrocarpus
frondosus</i> and <i>Myrospermum erythrozylon</i>).</p>

<p>We were next treated to a view of an extensive,
deliciously green valley, most excellent for grazing
purposes, extending from north to south to the west
of our route. In the central depression of this valley
were <i>burity</i> palms in abundance. They say that
wherever you find a burity you are sure to find water.
It is perfectly true, as the burity only flourishes where
there is a good deal of moisture in the soil.</p>

<p>Having crossed a low pass, we found ourselves in
another valley&mdash;this one sparsely wooded (2,500 ft.
above the sea level), very beautiful, with undulations
some 200 ft. high, and with streamlets at the bottom
of most of the undulations. The summit of the highest
elevation on that undulating land was 2,750 ft., the
level of the principal streamlet 2,600 ft. above the sea.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Twenty-nine</span> kilometres from the "Merry Rest" we
arrived at the little town of Pouso Alto&mdash;duly translated
"high camp"&mdash;situated 2,750 ft. above the sea level
on an elevation between the two rivers Piracanjuba,
and the Furmiga (which afterwards became the Rio
Meio Ponte<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing parenthesis">)</ins>, throwing itself into the Paranahyba River.</p>

<p>Pouso Alto was like all the other <i>villas</i> or settlements
of Goyaz, only perhaps a little larger. The
same whitewashed houses with doors and windows
decorated with blue, the same abandoned, deserted
look of the principal square and streets; in fact,
another "city of the dead." Only two men&mdash;drinking
in the local store&mdash;were visible in the whole village.</p>

<p>The usual impertinent questions had to be answered.</p>

<p>"Who are you? Why do you come here? Is
your country as beautiful as ours? Have you any
cities as large as ours in your country? How much
money have you? Are you married? You are
English; then you come here to steal our gold and
diamonds."</p>

<p>"Have you any gold and diamonds here?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-87" id="Pg_1-87"></a>[<a href="./images/1-87.png">87</a>]</span>
"No, you cannot travel for pleasure. The English
only travel to take away all the riches from other
countries! Those instruments you carry" (a compass
and two aneroids) "are those that tell you where to
dig for gold!"</p>

<p>I could not help remarking to this gentleman that
so far the country I had traversed seemed merely to
be rich in misery, that was all.</p>

<p>Nothing could be imagined more funereal than
those little towns. My men intended remaining there
for the night, but I insisted on pushing on for a few
more kilometres&mdash;especially as in these places my men
were led to drink and became unmanageable. On we
went for 9 kil. to the farm of Bellianti (elev. 2,500 ft.
above the sea level).</p>

<p>On April 8th we made an early start and travelled
through a luxuriant forest, which was daily getting
more and more tropical as we went farther north. We
were, of course, do not forget, south of the equator.</p>

<p>Thirteen kilometres from camp we crossed the Rio
Furmiga (or Meio Ponte) about 100 yards wide, flowing
there in a direction from east to west at an elevation
of 2,000 ft. Most gorgeous, richly verdant vegetation
overhung and festooned the banks of the stream.</p>

<p>As we went farther toward the interior the vegetation
grew more beautiful, the people more repulsive.
The majority of the people suffered from go&icirc;tre in
more or less advanced stages. Many were the persons
affected by leprosy.</p>

<p>We were in a region where oranges (imported, of
course) of most excellent juicy quality were obtainable&mdash;for
instance at the farm of Felicidade (elev. 2,350 ft.).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-88" id="Pg_1-88"></a>[<a href="./images/1-88.png">88</a>]</span>
All those farms&mdash;very old&mdash;showed signs of having seen
better days&mdash;no doubt when slavery existed in a legal
form in Brazil and it was possible to work those estates
profitably. With the prohibitive price of labour&mdash;and
in fact the impossibility of obtaining labour at any
price in the interior&mdash;farming cannot indeed flourish
to-day. The comparatively few immigrants who landed
at the various ports in Brazil were at once absorbed
near the coast, and seldom left the port of landing, where
labour was anxiously required.</p>

<p>For the first time, that day did I see two snakes,
which were concealed in the deep grooves left by a
cart wheel. One wound itself around the front leg of
my mule, and for a moment I was anxious lest the animal
had been bitten; but fortunately the snake, which had
been trodden upon, did no damage. Only rarely did
we see a bird anywhere, except in villages, where an
occasional crow, with its dried-up neck and jerky
motions, could be seen. How like the inhabitants those
birds were!</p>

<p class="figcenter">(The higher building is the church.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Twenty-seven kilometres farther we reached Santo
Antonio, a village situated in quite a heavenly spot,
2,800 ft. above the sea level, but in itself one of the
most miserable villages I have ever seen. There were
altogether some forty houses scattered about, eight of
which were along the sides of the principal square&mdash;an
abandoned field. The church had the appearance of
a disused barn. A large wooden cross stood in front
of it, upon which birds had built their nests. Four
thin, an&aelig;mic-looking palms stood at different angles
by the side of the cross. We had the misfortune to
stay there for the night. By seven o'clock everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-89" id="Pg_1-89"></a>[<a href="./images/1-89.png">89</a>]</span>
had barricaded their houses and had retired to sleep.
There was, of course, no such thing as a post-office
or a telegraph in the place. The nearest place where a
letter could be posted was some 72 kil. away on the
high road between Goyaz and Catal&atilde;o. Goats tied in
pairs, with a log of wood between in order to keep them
apart, seemed to have the run of the place, and were
the only things there which appeared to have any life
in them.</p>

<p>But if the place was miserable, if the natives were
repulsive and dull, there was plenty to be thankful
for in admiration of the really glorious country around,
and the superb sunsets to which we were treated
every evening. Again that evening, when everybody
in the place was slumbering, the sunset was more
wonderful than words can describe. The usual radiations,
which again reached the highest point of the
sky's vault, were that night white on the west, with
corresponding ones of brilliant cobalt blue to the east.</p>

<p>A drizzling rain rendered the night cold and damp,
although the Fahrenheit thermometer registered a
minimum temperature of 70&deg;.</p>

<p>On leaving S. Antonio the trail ascended to a height
of 3,100 ft. (4&frac12; kil. from the village), and we were
then in a rich forest region, where the <i>acaju</i>&mdash;of the
<i>Terebinthace&aelig;</i> family&mdash;was plentiful, with its huge
leaves and contorted branches. The acaju produced
a refreshing fruit, either of a bright red or else of a
yellow colour, not unlike a large pepper, outside of
which was strongly attached a seed possessing highly
caustic qualities. Many <i>gordinha</i> trees were also to
be seen. It was interesting to see how those zones of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-90" id="Pg_1-90"></a>[<a href="./images/1-90.png">90</a>]</span>
forest were suddenly succeeded by beautiful and vast
areas of grazing land, such as we found that day. We
crossed three streams at the respective elevations of
2,550 ft., 2,650 ft., and 2,750 ft., after which we reached
an elevation of 3,000 ft., the highest we had so far
attained on our route from the coast, where we found
ourselves on a grassy tableland of considerable beauty.
Looking back to the S.S.E., we perceived the two
hill ranges, one behind the other, which we had crossed.
Between them and us were marvellous slopes covered
with green grass, but not in the lower portion, where
bordering the stream was luxuriant forest. This was
noticeable also on a hill to the west, forming a minor
tableland with rounded sides.</p>

<p>To the N.N.E. was a perfectly flat plateau. The
distance rendered it of a deep blue, and its level sky-line
gave the appearance of the horizon upon the ocean,
except that there rose two small peaks which stood up
slightly above the elevation of the plateau. On all
that beautiful land only two small miserable farms
were to be seen. Yet it seemed to be a paradise on
earth&mdash;delightful climate, excellent soil, useful woods
in the forest, plenty of delicious water.</p>

<p>Three more streamlets flowing from west to east
were encountered at elevations of 2,700 ft., 2,750 ft.
and 2,800 ft., with undulating grassy land between of
wonderful beauty.</p>

<p>Having deviated somewhat from our route, we at
last descended into a grassy valley&mdash;absolutely flat&mdash;the
best of all we had seen. It had been fenced all round.
Upon inquiry, I learned that it had been acquired by
the Redemptionist Friars. There is one thing friars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-91" id="Pg_1-91"></a>[<a href="./images/1-91.png">91</a>]</span>
certainly know. It is how to select the best land
anywhere to settle upon.</p>

<p>We had travelled 46 kil. 200 m. that day when we
arrived at Campinas (elev. 2,550 ft. above the sea level)&mdash;the
usual kind of filthy village with tiny, one-storied
houses, more like toys than real liveable habitations.
This time the doors and windows were bordered with
grey instead of blue. On nearing those villages in Central
Brazil one frequently found an abundance of rough
wooden crosses scattered upon the landscape. They
marked the spots where individuals had been killed.</p>

<p>In the room where I put up in the village, in the
<i>hospedagem</i>, or rest-house, the floor was besmeared
with blood, the result of a recent murder. The shops
grew more and more uninteresting as we got farther
into the interior. The difficulties of transport were
naturally greater, the prices rose by leaps and bounds,
as we got farther; the population got poorer and poorer
for lack of enterprise. The articles of luxury and
vanity, so frequently seen in shops before, were now
altogether absent, and only bottles of inferior liquor
and beer were sold, matches and candles&mdash;that was
all. No trade, no industry, no money, existed in those
places. If one happened to pay with a five- or a ten-milreis
note (6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> or 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>), one could never obtain
change. Frequently, unless you wished to leave the
change behind, you were obliged to carry away the
balance in cheap stearine or beer. I took the stearine.
A short distance from the town was a seminary, with
four German friars, very fat, very jolly, very industrious.</p>

<p>Alcides, one of my men, was by way of being a
veterinary surgeon. Here is how he cured a wounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-92" id="Pg_1-92"></a>[<a href="./images/1-92.png">92</a>]</span>
mule, which, having received a powerful kick from
another animal, displayed a gash 3 in. long in her
back, and so deep that the entire hand could be inserted
and actually disappear into the wound. Francisco,
another of my men, having duly and firmly tied
the animal's legs&mdash;a sensible precaution&mdash;proceeded
with his naked arm to search for <i>bishus</i>: anything
living is a <i>bishu</i> in Brazil, from an elephant to a flea;
but in this particular case it was applied to insects,
such as <i>carrapatos</i>, maggots, or parasites, which might
have entered the wound. Having done this at considerable
length and care, he proceeded to tear off with
his nails the sore edges of the laceration, after which
he inserted into the gash a pad of cotton-wool soaked
in creoline. That was the treatment for the first day.
The second day, the wound proceeding satisfactorily,
he inserted into it, together with his hand, a whole
lemon in which he had made a cut, and squeezed its
juice within the raw flesh. The amazing part of it
all was that the animal, with an additional bath or
two of salt and water, absolutely recovered from the
wound and got perfectly well.</p>

<p>The Redemptionist monks had a fine vineyard
adjoining their monastery&mdash;the only one of any size
and importance we had seen since leaving the railway&mdash;and
also some lovely orange groves in a walled
enclosure. They had built a mill on the bank of the
stream. Most of that beautiful valley for miles and
miles belonged to them. The town of Campinas&mdash;not
to be confounded with Campinas of S&atilde;o Paulo
Province&mdash;had a population of 600 souls.</p>

<p>When we left that place the next morning, again we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-93" id="Pg_1-93"></a>[<a href="./images/1-93.png">93</a>]</span>
went across beautiful flat stretches of grassy land&mdash;several
miles long and broad&mdash;regular tablelands, at an
elevation of 2,700 ft.&mdash;most wonderful pasture lands
now going absolutely to waste. Plentiful streamlets
intersected those lovely meadows at a slightly lower
elevation&mdash;merely a few feet&mdash;where the water had
eroded itself a channel. Those streams were generally
bordered by a thick growth of trees and entangled
vegetation. We stopped for lunch at the farm of <i>Boa
Vista</i> (Belvedere or Fine View), so called&mdash;according
to the usual Brazilian way of reasoning&mdash;because it
was situated in a deep hollow from which you could
see nothing at all! Another more rational name
which this place also possessed was Bocca do Matto
(Mouth of the Forest), because it truly was at the
entrance of a thick forest extending to the north.</p>

<p>We went, in fact, from that point through densely
wooded country, although the trees were of no great
height or size. The ground was swampy and sloppy,
most unpleasant for marching, for some nineteen kilometres,
until we arrived at Goyabeira (elev. 2,700 ft.),
having covered 56 kil. 100 m. that day&mdash;not at all
bad marching considering that we could not change
animals and we conveyed all our baggage along with us.</p>

<p>I saw that day another snake, called by the natives
<i>duas cabecas</i> (and Tu Nou), or double-headed snake,
because its marking gives that impression at first sight.</p>

<p>After leaving Goyabeira the thick growth continued
over several ridges, the highest of which was 2,950 ft.,
with streams between at elevations respectively of
2,630 and 2,700 ft. I noticed in the forest some
beautiful paneira trees, with their trunks enlarged near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-94" id="Pg_1-94"></a>[<a href="./images/1-94.png">94</a>]</span>
the base&mdash;a regular swelling all round. One of the
peculiarities of this tree was that it produced a
kind of vegetable wool contained within fairly hard
capsules.</p>

<p>That was indeed a day of surprises for us. As we
were proceeding over another hill range between two
streams (elev. 2,850 ft.), we saw at last some butterflies
of a gorgeous lemon yellow, some of a rich orange,
others of red and black, great numbers of pure white,
and some huge ones of an indescribably beautiful
metallic blue colour. There were swarms of them
near the water. So unaccustomed were they to see
human beings that many settled on my white coat
and on my straw hat and came along undisturbed for
long distances upon my person. They were so beautiful
that I had not the desire to kill them, even for the
sake of bringing back a valuable collection. It would
have been easy to capture them, as you could touch
them several times with your fingers before they would
fly away. One butterfly particularly took a great
fancy to my left hand, in which I held the reins of my
mule, and on which it sat during our marches for several
days&mdash;much to my inconvenience, for I was afraid of
injuring it. It would occasionally fly away and then
return. At night while we were camping I transferred
it to my straw hat, on which it quietly remained until
the next morning. The moment I had mounted my
mule, the butterfly would at once fly again to my hand.
This great affection was due chiefly, I believe, not to
any magnetic attraction, but merely to the delicately
scented soap which I used in my morning bath, and
which greatly attracted the butterfly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-95" id="Pg_1-95"></a>[<a href="./images/1-95.png">95</a>]</span>
On many occasions on that expedition I had similar
experiences with butterflies.</p>

<p>For the first time, too, I perceived that day a few
<i>colibris</i>&mdash;tiny humming-birds of wonderful plumage.</p>

<p>Twenty-three kilometres from Goyabeira&mdash;after
many ups and downs along a deep-channelled, slushy
trail, and having crossed over several swampy, troublesome
streamlets&mdash;we suddenly emerged into a marvellous
undulating open plain with lovely grass and
numerous fat cattle grazing upon it. In the distance
upon the hill-side four or five farm-sheds could be
perceived. We had stopped at one farm on the way
in hopes of getting food, but they could only sell us
some <i>feij&atilde;o</i>&mdash;beans soaked in lard&mdash;so that it was with
some haste that we directed our mules to the more
imposing building in expectation of finding there at
least some rice and eggs. We hurriedly crossed the
plain and then the stream, and halted at the Cachoeira
Grande (Grand Rapid) farm, 2,950 ft. above the sea
level. A pure negro was in charge of the place, whose
wife was also as black as the ace of spades. Curiously
enough, they possessed a child much discoloured and
with golden hair and blue eyes. Such things will
happen in the best regulated countries. The black
man swore it was his own child, and we took&mdash;or,
rather, did not take&mdash;his word for it.</p>

<p>We went on thirteen more kilometres that afternoon,
when we were overtaken by a hurricane and torrential
rain which drenched us to the marrow of our bones.
We halted for the night at the farm of <i>Lagoa formosa</i>
(Beautiful Lagoon), 3,000 ft. above the sea level.</p>

<p>It was on April 12th that we proceeded to climb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-96" id="Pg_1-96"></a>[<a href="./images/1-96.png">96</a>]</span>
the dividing range between the waters flowing south
into the Paranahyba (afterward called the Parana)
River, and those flowing north eventually into the
Amazon. This range of mountains was by some called
Serra de Sta. Rita, by others Serra Dourada. It was
not possible to ascertain the real name from the local
people, who could tell me the names of no place, or
mountain, or stream, and hardly knew the names of
their own homes.</p>

<p>On a flat expanse some 13 kil. from Lagoa Formosa
we came upon a small lake. We travelled mostly across
campos (or prairies), with waters from that point flowing
northward. Seventeen kilometres farther we entered the
neat-looking village of Curralhino (elev. 2,600 ft.), with
two squares and streets actually with names to them.
We were from this point on the main route between
S&atilde;o Paulo and the capital of Goyaz, and also met there
the telegraph line between Goyaz and S&atilde;o Paulo.</p>

<p>We were getting near the capital of the province.
A little more life was noticeable in this settlement
than in those we had met before. Caravans of mules
and horses occasionally passed through, and bullock-carts,
with eighteen and twenty oxen, slowly and
squeakily crept along. We were going through a region
that was more than hilly&mdash;almost mountainous&mdash;the
first of the kind we had encountered since leaving
the railway.</p>

<p class="fsc">Burity Palms.</p>
<hr />
<p>At Camp Maria Alves we were at an elevation of
3,000 ft. Beautiful crystals were to be found at and
near this place. Many were enclosed in hard envelopes
of yellow lava, which contained besides semi-crystallized
matter easily crushed&mdash;to be strictly accurate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-97" id="Pg_1-97"></a>[<a href="./images/1-97.png">97</a>]</span>
the imprisoned infinitesimal crystals were easily separated,
under gentle pressure. Some spherical balls
and pellets of lava I picked up, when split contained
red baked earth which had evidently been subjected
to intense heat. In the centre of these pellets one or
more crystals of great clearness were invariably to be
found. These pellets must have been expelled with
terrific force from a volcanic vent, and must have
travelled great distances, for the depression where I
found them had a surface of alluvial formation.</p>

<p>On April 13th we again rose over a range where we
encountered a good deal of igneous rock and quantities
of beautiful crystals. We had a range to the west of
us and one higher and more important to the north-east,
the latter more broken up than any we had so
far seen in the three last provinces crossed. We somehow
missed now the lovely pasture lands of the day
before, so refreshing to the eye, and the landscape had
suddenly become more rugged and barren, except near
water. Some 9 kil. from the farm Maria Alves the Uru
or Uruba River (elev. 2,550 ft.) flowed north&mdash;there
merely a picturesque torrent among rocks and overhanging
vegetation on both banks.</p>

<p>The wonderful effect of erosion was noticeable on
the mountain sides to the north of us, where it had
left a top terrace with deep corrugations in the lower
sides of the mountain. A miserable-looking farmhouse
could be seen here and there&mdash;quite as miserable as the
country in itself was rich. Some shaggy policemen,
in rags and barefooted, passed us, guarding an ox-cart
dragging treasure to the capital. Only the oxen and
some cows which were about looked at us with interest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-98" id="Pg_1-98"></a>[<a href="./images/1-98.png">98</a>]</span>
and sniffed us&mdash;it is wonderful how quick animals
are at detecting the presence of strangers&mdash;but the
people took no notice of us. Here and there a tumbled-down
tree blocked the way. There were tracts of
pasture land. My men were considerably excited on
seeing a poisonous snake crawl swiftly towards our
mules. It was perhaps an absent-minded or a short-sighted
snake, for no sooner did it realize our presence
than it quickly veered round to escape. My men
killed it.</p>

<p>At an elevation of 2,550 ft. we met a limpid stream
of most delicious water. At that particular spot it
flowed south.</p>

<p>We were now confronted with a range of actual
mountains. The trail took us over wonderful rugged
scenery, masses of pillar-like grey rock of granitic
formation. On the summit of the pass we were over
strata of half-solidified tufa in sheets&mdash;or foliated&mdash;easily
crumbled and finely powdered between one's
fingers. The strata were at an angle of 45&deg;, showing
that they had undergone some disturbance. They had
been subjected to great heat, for in some places they
had been hard baked, which rendered them of a yellowish
brown colour. On the left of us&mdash;to the west&mdash;a great
vertical pillar of rock plainly showed the stratification,
the continuation of which could be followed
on the opposite side of the pass, both in the horizontal
strata and those which had been forced up at an angle.
Looking back from the pass, we obtained a heavenly
panorama of wooded hills to the south-east, far, far
beyond in the background, and of glorious campos
between them and us. With the winter coming on&mdash;of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-99" id="Pg_1-99"></a>[<a href="./images/1-99.png">99</a>]</span>
course you know that south of the equator they have
their winter when we have our summer&mdash;beautiful
yellowish, reddish and brown tints of the foliage added
picturesqueness to the landscape.</p>

<p>The pass itself was 2,850 ft. above the sea level.
There was not much in the way of vegetation, barring
a few stunted <i>sucupira</i> trees. The air was exquisitely
pure and the water of two streamlets at 2,550 ft.
delicious and cool. We were marching over quantities
of marble fragments and beautiful crystals, which
shone like diamonds in the sun. Having gone over
the pass, we came upon a most extraordinary geological
surprise. There seemed to have been in ages long
gone by a great subsidence of the region north of us.
We were then on the steep edge of what remained of
the plateau, and down, down in the depth below was
an immense valley in which Goyaz city lay.</p>

<p>To the west of us&mdash;as I stood impressed by that
awe-striking scene&mdash;we had the irregularly-cut continuation
of the edge of the plateau on which we stood,
supported as it were on a pillar-like granitic wall of
immense height and quite vertical, resting on a gently
sloping base down to the bottom of the vast basin
below.</p>

<p>This great natural wall of gneiss, which contained
myriads of crystals and mica schists, shone like silver
in the spots where the sun struck it, and with the lovely
pure cobalt blue of the distant hills, the deep green
of the valley below, and the rich brown and yellow
and red tints of the near foreground, made one of the
most exquisitely beautiful sights I have ever witnessed.
The nearest approach to it in my experience was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-100" id="Pg_1-100"></a>[<a href="./images/1-100.png">100</a>]</span>
perhaps, the eastern escarpment of the Abyssinian
plateau in Africa, where a similar panorama on a much
smaller scale could be seen, but not the same geological
formation.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-100.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-100_th.jpg" alt="The President of Goyaz and his Family." title="The President of Goyaz and his Family." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">The President of Goyaz and his Family.</p>
<p class="figcenter">Giant cactus in the background.</p>
<hr />
<p>No sooner had I recovered from the strangeness
and marvellous beauty of Nature's work around me,
than I felt a great shock at seeing what men had done
in that region. We were at this point on the high
road between S&atilde;o Paulo, Uberaba and Goyaz capital.
As my animals stumbled down the steep escarpment
traces could be seen of what must have been formerly
a beautiful paved road, well-drained on both sides with
channels, and held up in terraces by stone works where
the gradient was steepest. Here and there bits still
remained, demonstrating how well the road had been
made. But, uncared for and abandoned, most of it
had been washed away by the heavy rains, which had
turned that road into a foaming torrent in wet weather.
Near habitations, the well-cut slabs with which the
road was paved had come convenient to the natives
for building purposes. During the time of the Emperor
Pedro II., I was told, that was a magnificent road,
kept in excellent repair.</p>

<p>Goyaz city lay before us down, down below, in the
hollow of the huge depression. Its single row of low
whitewashed houses of humble architectural pretensions
became less and less impressive and less picturesque as
one got nearer. I had by that time grown quite accustomed
to this optical disillusion, for it was frequently
the case with the work of man in Brazil. It always
needed distance&mdash;the greater distance the better&mdash;to
lend enchantment to it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-101" id="Pg_1-101"></a>[<a href="./images/1-101.png">101</a>]</span>
With a feeling of intense oppression&mdash;perhaps due
to the stifling air and the lower elevation (1,950 ft.)
at which Goyaz city lay&mdash;we entered the capital of
Goyaz. At the sound of our mules upon the pavement,
timid men, timid women and children cautiously peeped
from each window through the half-closed Venetian
blinds. We only had to turn round to peep at them,
and with terrified squeals the hidden creatures banged
and bolted the windows. The sight of a stranger in
Goyaz was apparently an event. Whether we were
expected or not, I do not know, but the whole population
seemed to be hiding behind the tiny windows
to look at us. The few who were caught in the street
seemed as if they wanted to bow but had not the
courage to do it. Indeed, their timidity was intensely
amusing. Some, more courageous, gave a ghastly
grin, displaying rows of irregular teeth in a terrible
condition of decay.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the City of Goyaz</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no such thing as an hotel in Goyaz capital.
The nearest approach to it was a filthy rest-house
for muleteers, which was, furthermore, already full.
Against my usual custom&mdash;as I never, unless absolutely
necessary, make use of the credentials I carry for my
private needs&mdash;I had, therefore, to apply to the Presidente
or Governor of the Province to find some sort of
accommodation in the town for my animals, men, and
myself.</p>

<p>"Take off your spurs before you enter!" roughly
shouted a sentry at the Governor's palace&mdash;a huge
barn-like structure&mdash;just as I was stooping to do that
before being asked.</p>

<p>"Do not stand on the pavement," said the sentry
again, anxious to display his authority.</p>

<p>Being a law-abiding person I shifted to one side.</p>

<p>"Do not stop under the Presidente's window!"
cried the policeman angrily once more, digging me in
the ribs with his bayonet.</p>

<p>I was beginning to be sorry I had not brought an
aeroplane with me in order to complete my toilet in
the air before entering so sacred a precinct, but patience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-103" id="Pg_1-103"></a>[<a href="./images/1-103.png">103</a>]</span>
being one of my chief virtues I transferred myself to
the remotest point across the square, where, stork-like,
upon one foot at a time I was able&mdash;this time undisturbed&mdash;to
remove both spurs.</p>

<p>"Take off your hat before entering," again shouted
the policeman, as I was still some fifteen yards from
the door.</p>

<p>I really began to feel rather nervous, with all those
orders grunted at me. I wondered at the strange
people who must visit the palace to have to be instructed
to such an extent before entering. I also stopped for
a moment to ponder whether I had taken off all that
was necessary to enter a palace where so much etiquette
was required.</p>

<p>The moment I entered things were different. I was
ushered into an ante-room, where I had to go through
a short cross-examination by some police officers. Then,
when they had made sure of my identity, they immediately
led me before the Presidente.</p>

<p>The Presidente greeted me with effusion. He was
a most polished and charming gentleman from Rio de
Janeiro, had travelled extensively in Europe, and could
speak French and English. He roared heartily when I
told him of my experience outside his palace.</p>

<p>"They are all savages here," he told me; "you
must not mind. The sentry has orders to keep everybody
away from the palace, as people come in the
afternoon and squat under my windows to jabber, and
I cannot sleep. Those orders, I assure you, were not
meant for you. You will be my guest all the time you
are in the city, and I can accept no excuse."</p>

<p>The Presidente placed a small house near the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-104" id="Pg_1-104"></a>[<a href="./images/1-104.png">104</a>]</span>
palace at my disposal, and insisted on my having
all meals with his family&mdash;most refined, handsome,
exquisitely polite wife and daughters.</p>

<p>I presented the credentials I possessed from the
Minister of Agriculture in Rio and the Brazilian Ambassador
in London, requesting the Presidente to do all
in his power to further the success of the expedition&mdash;I,
of course, paying all expenses. The Presidente, like
most other Brazilians of a certain age, was <i>blas&eacute;</i> beyond
words. Nothing interested him except his family, and
life was not worth living. He believed in nothing. He
was an atheist because he had not been as successful
as he wished in the world, and attributed the fault to
God. He cared little about the future of his country.
If his country and all his countrymen went to a warmer
place than Heaven, he would be glad to see them go
that way! As for going exploring, mapping unknown
regions, studying the country and the people, building
roads, railways and telegraphs, it little mattered to
him, but it seemed all nonsense.</p>

<p>"Instead of coming to these wild, deadly regions,
why do you not go and spend your money enjoying
yourself in Paris or Vienna?" was his advice to
me.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I need a change occasionally, and I enjoy
things all the more by contrast when I return to
Europe."</p>

<p>The Presidente was evidently not in good health
and spirits. He was a Senator of the Republic, and
a man formerly of great ambitions, which were more
or less shattered when he was elected Governor of
Goyaz Province, with its population of corpses, and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-105" id="Pg_1-105"></a>[<a href="./images/1-105.png">105</a>]</span>
a salary of &pound;40 a month&mdash;very little more than I paid
my head muleteer&mdash;so that little could be expected
from the Governor of such a Province.</p>

<p>It was thus that the State of Goyaz, one of the
naturally richest in Brazil&mdash;it contained pasture lands
unique for their beauty, forests with valuable woods,
plenty of water and great navigable rivers draining
it both north and south, of which it was sufficient to
mention the magnificent Araguaya River, the Rio
Tocantins and the Paranahyba (or Parana)&mdash;was
instead one of the poorest. In the very heart of
Brazil, Goyaz was geographically and politically the
centre of the Republic. With an area of 747,311 sq. kil.
(288,532 sq. miles), the Province had an estimated
population of some 280,000 souls, or less than one to
every square mile.</p>

<p>The region forming the present State of Goyaz was
first explored in 1647 by Manoel Correa, a native of
S&atilde;o Paulo, and in 1682 by another Paulista, Bartholomeu
Bueno de Silva, who both were prospecting for
gold. The latter was successful in locating gold mines
and in making friends with the local Indians of the
Goyaz tribe, from whom the Province then took its
name. Some forty-three years later de Silva returned
to S&atilde;o Paulo with 918 ounces of gold. The news of
these goldfields quickly attracted a great number of
adventurers to Goyaz. The country then saw its most
prosperous days, especially in and near Villa Boa, the
present city of Goyaz, where gold was said to have been
plentiful in those days.</p>

<p>The enterprising Bartholomeu Bueno de Silva returned
to Goyaz in 1731 as a Capit&atilde;o Mor, or Grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-106" id="Pg_1-106"></a>[<a href="./images/1-106.png">106</a>]</span>
Captain, with the right to dispose of land. In 1822
Goyaz was recognized as a Province of the Empire,
and subsequently in 1869 it became one of the States
of the Union, with autonomy as regards local affairs
under its own Constitution approved by the Federal
Constituent Assembly in 1891.</p>

<p>Cattle, horse and mule breeding on a small scale
was the chief source of income of that magnificent
State&mdash;an income which in less indolent hands might
be increased ten-thousand-fold or more. Its horses and
mules found a ready market in the adjacent State
of Matto Grosso and from there went into Bolivia,
while the States of Minas Geraes and S&atilde;o Paulo were
the chief buyers of pigs, <i>toucinho</i> (dried pork fat), dried
beef, hides raw and cured, cheese, lard, etc.</p>

<p>Goyaz prided itself greatly on its horses, which
enjoyed a certain fame all over Brazil. Perhaps they
were in a way as good as any produced in the Republic.
With a little study and care in the breeding they
might be greatly improved and rendered as sturdy and
good-looking as some horses of Asia and Northern
Africa. So far they were far inferior in appearance
and endurance to the horses of Arabia, Turkestan,
Europe and Abyssinia.</p>

<p>The most interesting type of the Goyaz horse was
what is called the <i>curraleiro</i> or "stable horse," bred
in the north of the State, especially in the valley
of Paranan, bordering upon Minas and Bahia. The
curraleiro was also known as <i>cavallo sertanejo</i> or
"horse of the jungle"&mdash;two most inappropriate names,
for it was, accurately speaking, neither one nor the
other.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-107" id="Pg_1-107"></a>[<a href="./images/1-107.png">107</a>]</span>
The Goyaz horse was a typical Brazilian horse. It
shared many of the characteristics of the people of
the Province. Timidity, laziness, lack of affection and
judgment, sulkiness and great stubbornness under training
of any kind were its qualities. This was due chiefly,
I think, to its inferior intelligence when compared with
thoroughbred horses of other nations. The Goyaz
horse was small, fairly agile, and when well cared for
had a handsome shiny coat with luxuriant mane and
tail. It was capable of short, noteworthy efforts, but
did not possess abnormal endurance.</p>

<p>The present curraleiro is a mere degeneration of
what must have formerly been an excellent horse.
Considering the absolute lack of care taken in its breeding,
it was certainly remarkable that it proved to be as
good a horse as it actually was. Judiciously crossed
with Hungarian, Turkestan, Arab or Abyssinian horses,
I think that quite excellent results might be obtained.
It must be taken into consideration that great hardships
and work of the roughest character were demanded of
animals in Central Brazil.</p>

<p>A praiseworthy movement was started some years
ago by Marechal Hermes da Fonseca, now President
of the Republic, to mount the entire Brazilian Cavalry
on national horses. That will perhaps lead some day
to a great improvement in the breeding of animals
all over the country, and especially in Goyaz, which
provided the most suitable land for that purpose. The
same remarks could, perhaps, in a slightly lesser degree,
be applied to the breeding of donkeys and mules. No
care whatever was exercised by the breeders in order to
improve the breeds. Everything was left to luck and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-108" id="Pg_1-108"></a>[<a href="./images/1-108.png">108</a>]</span>
chance. The result was that a degenerate type of
animal was produced&mdash;wonderful indeed, considering
the way it was bred, but which might be improved to
an immense extent and made into a remarkable animal,
in such a propitious climate and with such marvellous
pasture lands.</p>

<p>With cattle also, it is safe to assert that, since the
colonial time, very little fresh foreign blood of any
importance has been introduced in breeding&mdash;except,
perhaps, some inferior types of the Indian humped
zebu. Most of the stock I saw in Southern Goyaz was
intermixed with zebu. The formerly existing bovine
races, such as the Mocha, Cora&ccedil;u and Crioula have now
almost altogether disappeared.</p>

<p>Unlike most other States of Brazil, Goyaz had no
Provincial Customs duties. With its immense frontier,
bordering upon seven different other States, it would
be impossible to enforce the collection of payments.
No reliable statistics were obtainable as to the amount
of exports or imports of the State. Even approximately
it would be impossible to make a guess as to
the actual amount of the resources of the State.</p>

<p>Sugar-cane and tobacco could be profitably grown
in the State. The small quantity of tobacco grown
there was of excellent quality.</p>

<p>The Government of Goyaz Province consisted of
three Powers: the Executive, represented by the
President, elected for three years by universal suffrage;
the Legislature&mdash;a Chamber of Deputies equally elected
for three years by suffrage; and a Judicial power constituted
by the High Court of Justice, <i>Juges de droit</i>&mdash;law
judges&mdash;and District Judges. To be elected Presi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-109" id="Pg_1-109"></a>[<a href="./images/1-109.png">109</a>]</span>dent
of Goyaz State all that was necessary was to be
a Brazilian citizen, over thirty years of age, and able
to read and write. The same applied to the election
of Deputies&mdash;for whom a residence of only two years
in the State was sufficient.</p>

<p>The capital of Goyaz&mdash;situated on the Rio Vermelho,
a tributary of the great Araguaya River&mdash;had, according
to the census of 1900, a population of some 13,475
people, but I rather doubt whether it possessed as many
as 8 to 10,000 souls when I visited it. One could notice
indications that Goyaz had been in days gone by a
flourishing place. There were a number of fine churches,
and a large cathedral in course of construction&mdash;but
since abandoned. Some of the buildings, too&mdash;the
finest was the prison&mdash;must have been quite handsome,
but were now in a dilapidated condition. It was
really heart-breaking to see such a magnificent country
go to rack and ruin&mdash;a State naturally the richest
perhaps in Brazil, yet rendered the poorest, deeply
steeped in debt, and with the heavy weight of absurdly
contracted loans from which it had no hope whatever
of recovering under present conditions. They had in
the province the most beautiful land in Brazil, but it
was a land of the dead. People, industries, trade, commerce,
everything was dead. Formerly, in the time
of the Emperor and of that great patriot General
Couto de Magalh&atilde;es, Goyaz city could be reached&mdash;within
a few kilometres&mdash;by steam on the beautiful
river Araguaya, which formed the western boundary of
the province, an ideal waterway navigable for 1,200 kil.&mdash;in
Goyaz province alone. In the time of the Emperor,
when Brazil was a wild country, steam navigation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-110" id="Pg_1-110"></a>[<a href="./images/1-110.png">110</a>]</span>
actually existed up the Araguaya River from Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o
as far as Leopoldina (the port for Goyaz city). The
river was free from obstacles of any kind, even in the
rainy season. There were then three beautiful English-built
launches on that service. A fine repairing shop
had been erected at Leopoldina.</p>

<p>But in these days of civilization, order and progress,
the steamers have been purposely run aground and
left to rot. There was actually a tree growing through
the hull of one of those launches when I last heard of
them; the machine shop was robbed of all its tools,
and the machinery destroyed and abandoned. The
Presidente told me that the Provincial Government
had eventually bought the wrecks of the launches
and the machine shops for &pound;20&mdash;and as it cost too
much to leave a man in charge everything had since
been abandoned.</p>

<p>When I visited Goyaz there was no sign and no
hope of re-establishing steam navigation on that marvellous
waterway.</p>

<p>The Tocantins River, which intersected the Province
from Goyaz city to its most northern point, was
also another serviceable stream&mdash;but no one used it,
except, perhaps, some rare private canoe taking up
goods to settlements on its banks.</p>

<p>The navigation of the Tocantins, when I was in
Goyaz, extended merely to the Port of Alcoba&ccedil;a, 350 kil.
from Para, from which point rapids existed which
made steam navigation impossible as far as Praia da
Rainha. The distance of 180 kil. between those two
places was eventually to be traversed by a railway, a
a concession for which had been granted to the Estrada<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-111" id="Pg_1-111"></a>[<a href="./images/1-111.png">111</a>]</span>
de Ferro Norte do Brazil. In the High Tocantins I
believe two steam launches were temporarily running
as far as Porto Nacional or perhaps a little higher.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the State of Goyaz will some day,
notwithstanding its apathetic inhabitants, see great
changes for the better. The new epoch will begin
when the several railways which were in course of
construction from various directions enter the Province.
Not one of them had penetrated the Province
at the time of my visit, although the work of preparing
the road had just been begun on Goyaz territory, as
we have seen, for a few kilometres north of the Paranahyba
River, on the extension of the Mogyana line from
S&atilde;o Paulo. A second railway line in course of construction
was a branch of the Western Minas Railway;
and there was a third up the Araguaya from Para.
Those railways will certainly revolutionize the country.
The inhabitants of Goyaz, ultra-conservative in their
ideas, were not at all anxious to see a railway reach
their capital. In their curious way of reasoning they
seemed to think that the railway would make life
dearer in the city, that strangers would be coming in
great numbers to reap the benefit of their country,
and that the younger people who were satisfied to live
there&mdash;because they could not get away&mdash;would all fly
to the coast as soon as the railway was established,
to enjoy the luxuries of Rio and S&atilde;o Paulo, of which
they had heard, but could so far only dream of. They
did not stop to think that the railways will certainly
make Goyaz the richest country in the world.</p>

<p>The financial condition of that beautiful State can
perhaps best be shown by quoting the words of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-112" id="Pg_1-112"></a>[<a href="./images/1-112.png">112</a>]</span>
Presidente himself in his message to the Legislative
Congress of Goyaz on May 13th, 1910, on assuming
the Presidency of the Province.</p>

<p>"On my assuming the Government of the Province,
I ordered the Secretary of Finance to give an account
of the balance existing in the State Treasury; and it
was verified that up to April 30th last there existed a
sum of Rs. 87,000,000 (&pound;5,800 sterling), which became
reduced to Rs. 50,000,000 (&pound;3,334 sterling) after the
payments made on the 1st, 3rd, and 4th of the present
month (May, 1910). It must be understood that the
above-mentioned sum does not represent a balance
existing in the Treasury, because it includes deposits
and guarantees, as well as the deposits of the Orphan
Asylum and of the Monte Pio.</p>

<p>"Leaving out the sums left in the Treasury on
deposit, and which represent in fact a debt of the State,
we come to the conclusion that there is no money whatever
in the Treasury, and that the State '<i>ainda fica a
dever</i>' (is instead deep in debt). The expenses were vastly
higher than the income of the Province and whereas
the expenses of administration increased daily, the
receipts remained stationary."</p>

<p>There was a certain humour in the Presidente's
remarks on crime, when he referred to the difficulties
experienced by the Chief of Police, who received no
remuneration.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-112.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-112_th.jpg" alt="The Author's Six Followers." title="The Author's Six Followers." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">The Author's Six Followers.</p>
<hr />
<p>"It is easy," he said, "to understand the drawbacks
resulting for the maintenance of order and the repression
of crime, which is daily becoming more common&mdash;owing,
no doubt, to the facility of entrance, through our unguarded
boundaries, of persecuted people or fugitives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-113" id="Pg_1-113"></a>[<a href="./images/1-113.png">113</a>]</span>
from our neighbouring States, and of the impunity of
criminals due to the benevolence of our juries. The
diminution of our police force in so large a State with
such difficult communications has had the result that
the police force, moved incessantly from one end of
the State to the other, never arrives in time to prevent
crime!</p>

<p>"Many criminals have been prosecuted and are
now safely guarded in prisons, but unhappily the
greater number of criminals are loose all over the State
without fear of being prosecuted, and terrorizing the
population. Bands of gipsies were followed by officers
and soldiers, and their attacks on property and individuals
were prevented.... In the town of Catal&atilde;o
the two armed parties were successfully prevented from
violence and '<i>viessem &aacute;s m&aacute;os</i>' (coming to blows). At
Morrinhos armed citizens in a menacing attitude were
dispersed by the police ... in other localities other
riots or attempts (<i>sic</i>) at disorder were immediately
repressed, and we can now say that the State enjoys
perfect peace, save the municipality of Douro, which is
threatened by bandits from Bahia. They are constantly
springing upon the terrified population of the
municipality and especially of the town.</p>

<p>"... The bandits continue their incursions; murders
follow one another in the entire zone between
Formosa and Barreiros, including Santa Rita and
Campo Largo, the inhabitants of which zone are paralyzed
with terror.... Our commerce with Bahia, as
well as relations between private individuals, is thus
interrupted."</p>

<p>In his message the Presidente wisely and frankly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-114" id="Pg_1-114"></a>[<a href="./images/1-114.png">114</a>]</span>
disclosed the difficulty of administering justice under
existing laws, when juries would absolve proved and
confessed murderers wholesale. He endeavoured to
stimulate some sense of honour in the officials in charge
of the various municipalities, where "<i>as rendas em geral
mal applicadas</i>" (the revenue generally misapplied)
found its way into channels through which it was not
intended to pass.</p>

<p>A fervent appeal the Presidente made to prevent
the spread of smallpox. The vaccine which the Government
sent to various points of the State was not used.</p>

<p>Curious, indeed, but perfectly true, were his statements
regarding the police force.</p>

<p>"The officers are zealous and understand their
duty. The policemen, notwithstanding all their defects,
are being instructed and disciplined. The policemen
are in general 'criminals' (<i>morigerados</i>). <i>Ha falta de
armamento, e o existente n&atilde;o &eacute; o melhor.</i> (There is lack
of armament and the existing one is not the best.)
The pay is small ... and the body needs reorganization."</p>

<p>The Academy of Law (<i>Academia de direito</i>) was not
satisfactory and did not answer the purpose for which
it was established.</p>

<p>The Lyceum, with its 105 pupils, gave fair results,
barring the tolerance in examinations, which, however,
did not reach a criminal point (<i>sic</i>). It possessed no
building of its own, and was badly housed in a private
dwelling.</p>

<p>Public instruction was admittedly defective all over
the province. The teachers were almost as ignorant
and illiterate as the people who went to learn&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-115" id="Pg_1-115"></a>[<a href="./images/1-115.png">115</a>]</span>
perhaps more so; while the Escola Normal (Normal
School) for women was almost altogether unattended.
The public works were uncared for&mdash;there was not a
single new work of art begun in the State. Nor could
the State boast of a single road or trail or bridge in
fair condition.</p>

<p>The laws on the possession of land would one day
lead to immense difficulties and confusion. The greater
part of the land now occupied was in the hands of
people who had no legal right whatever to it.</p>

<p>The existing laws on mining were equally unsatisfactory,
and the Presidente rightly remarked that
"without facilities and guarantees, capitalists will
never venture upon so risky and problematic an enterprise
as mining in a State so distant and so difficult of
access." He also exhorted the people to re-establish
steam navigation on the Araguaya River, such as existed
in the days of the Empire.</p>

<p>I was told that a launch had actually been purchased
in the United States, but was either waiting at Par&aacute;
for want of an engineer or else had again been sold
owing to the impossibility&mdash;due to lack of money&mdash;of
its being transported in sections over the rapids above
Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o.</p>

<p>The question of boundaries with neighbouring
States was an amusing one. According to some rule
for which no one can account, the Government of Goyaz
claimed from the State of Matto Grosso enormous
stretches of land on the opposite side of its natural,
indisputable geographical western boundary, the main
stream Araguaya, as well as the isolated settlement of
Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o, on the opposite side of the Araguaya River,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-116" id="Pg_1-116"></a>[<a href="./images/1-116.png">116</a>]</span>
which was undoubtedly in the State of Par&aacute;. One
only had to glance at a map&mdash;bad as maps were&mdash;to
see that in both cases the claim was an absurd one.
In the case of Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o it was perfectly ridiculous.
The Par&aacute; Government held the place with a military
force and occupied the territory with complete jurisdiction.
In a more peaceful manner the State of Matto
Grosso was in possession of the entire territory west of
the Rio Grande do Araguaya, which the people of
Goyaz said belonged to them. On the west the
Araguaya formed a perfect geographical boundary from
the Southern Goyaz boundary&mdash;where the Araguaya
had its birth&mdash;as far as the most northern point of
the State; whereas, were one to accept the supposed
Goyaz boundary formed by the Rio das Mortes&mdash;a
tributary of lesser volume than the main stream&mdash;it
would involve an imaginary compound boundary line
up the Pared&atilde;o stream, then up the Rio Barreiros, then
an imaginary straight line from north to south across
mountainous country, winding its way east until it
met the Serra dos Bahus, then again north-east over
undetermined country, then along the Rio Apor&eacute; and
eventually joining the Paranahyba River.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, nearly all the Brazilian Government
maps&mdash;and all the foreign ones copied, of course,
from the Brazilian, all remarkable for their inaccuracies&mdash;gave
the wrong boundary as the correct one! In any
case, both the States of Matto Grosso and Par&aacute; were
in actual occupation of the respective disputed territories,
and Goyaz was much too poor to afford fighting
for them, so that I fear her most unreasonable claims
will ever remain unsatisfied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-117" id="Pg_1-117"></a>[<a href="./images/1-117.png">117</a>]</span>
The final blow to the financial status of the Province
was the loan raised on the Banco do Brazil of
Rs. 300,000,000 (&pound;20,000 sterling) at an interest of 7 per
cent per annum. The Presidente counted on the receipts
from the exports as well as on economy in administration
in order to pay the interest on this sum&mdash;a dream
which soon became impossible to realize.</p>

<p>It was then attempted to float an internal loan of
Rs. 200,000,000 (about &pound;13,334 sterling) at an interest of
6 per cent; but, as the Presidente pathetically ended
his message to the State Congress, "not a single person
presented himself to subscribe to the loan."</p>

<p>The receipts from the export of cattle from Goyaz
State amounted in 1910 to only Rs. 171,901,000 (or
&pound;11,460 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> sterling). After all expenses were
deducted the State of Goyaz then showed a deficit of
Rs. 325,510,743 (&pound;21,700 14<i>s.</i> 4<i>d</i>. sterling).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the town of Goyaz that I had entertained
hopes of finding suitable followers to accompany my
expedition. The officials in Rio de Janeiro had given
me glowing accounts of the bravery of the people
of Goyaz. According to them those settlers of the
interior were all daredevils, courageous beyond words,
and I should have no difficulty whatever in finding
plenty of men who, for a consideration, would join

Colonel had exclaimed enthusiastically to me

to the Presidente and other officials of Goyaz,

When I presented these documents, I explained
clearly to the Presidente that all I wished was that
he should help me to collect thirty plucky men, whom
I would naturally pay, and pay well, out of my own
pocket, feed and clothe, during the entire time the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-119" id="Pg_1-119"></a>[<a href="./images/1-119.png">119</a>]</span>
expedition lasted, as well as pay all their expenses
back and wages up to the day of reaching their original
point of departure.</p>

<p>"I cannot help you; you will get nobody. Besides,
I have received an official but confidential message
from Rio requesting me to do all I can to prevent your
going on."</p>

<p>Such treachery seemed inconceivable to me, and I
took no notice of it. I again requested the Presidente
to endeavour to find me men and animals, as nothing
would deter me from going on. If no Brazilians came,
I said that I would go alone, but that the value of the
expedition would naturally suffer, as I should thus have
to leave behind all the instruments, cameras, and other
impedimenta, which, single-handed, I could not possibly
carry.</p>

<p>It was my intention to travel north-west from Goyaz
city as far as the River Araguaya. There I wanted to
descend the Araguaya as far as the Tapirapez River&mdash;a
small tributary on the west side of the Araguaya,
shown on some of the very incorrect existing maps
approximately in Lat. 11&deg; S., and on others in Lat. 9&deg;
and some minutes S. Proceeding westward from that
point again, I proposed crossing over to the Xingu
River, then to the Tapajoz, and farther to the Madeira
River. It was necessary for me to hire or purchase a
canoe in order to descend the Araguaya River as far
as the Tapirapez.</p>

<p>Believing that perhaps I might be able to find
men without the assistance of the Governor, I tried
every possible channel in Goyaz. I sent men all round
the town offering high pay. I applied to the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-120" id="Pg_1-120"></a>[<a href="./images/1-120.png">120</a>]</span>manding
officer of the Federal troops. I applied to
the Dominican monks, who have more power in Goyaz
State than all the officials taken together.</p>

<p>The Father Superior of the Dominicans shook his
head at once and told me that, much as he wished to
oblige me, I was asking for something impossible. He
was right. The people were so scared of the Indians,
and of the horrors of camping in the jungle, that no
money in the world would ever induce them to move
out of their town.</p>

<p>"Are there no young fellows in the town who will
come along for the love of adventure as well as the
money they will get?" I asked.</p>

<p>"For love! ... love!" said the friar, bursting
with laughter. "I do not believe that such a thing
exists in Brazil."</p>

<p>Having removed "love or money" from the
programme of temptation, there remained little else
except patience. In the meantime I endeavoured to
hire a canoe. The Presidente kindly undertook to do
this for me with the help of a well-known Colonel,
one of the most revered men in the city.</p>

<p>"There is only one boat on the Araguaya," said the
Presidente to me. "You cannot build a raft, as all
the woods in these regions are too heavy and not one
will float. You must hire that boat or nothing."</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-120a.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-120a_th.jpg" alt="View of Goyaz City from Sta. Barbara." title="View of Goyaz City from Sta. Barbara." /></a></p>

<p class="fsc">Author's Men packing Animals.</p>
<hr />
<p>The honoured Colonel his friend also impressed that
point well upon me. "Only that boat or nothing."
They also added that they had arranged for me to hire
that boat for four days, and it would only cost me
&pound;500 sterling. My distinguished friends had taken ten
days to arrange that bargain. It took me ten seconds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-121" id="Pg_1-121"></a>[<a href="./images/1-121.png">121</a>]</span>
to disarrange it all. All the more as I had heard that
a German traveller, Dr. Krause, had the previous year
gone down the Araguaya River, where he had done
excellent research work, and had also travelled up the
tributary Tapirapez, crossing over nearly as far as the
Xingu River. He had found in that region no Indians
and the country of little interest. Furthermore, on my
arrival in Goyaz capital I learnt that a Brazilian Government
expedition, under the leadership of Dr. Pimentel,
had already been in Goyaz some six months trying to
start on a journey down the Araguaya, and, if possible,
also to go up the Tapirapez and other tributaries of
that great stream. Moreover, the Araguaya was perhaps,
after the Madeira, one of the best known southern
tributaries of the Amazon. As we have already seen,
during the time of Dom Pedro, the Emperor, there was
even steam navigation almost all along the course of
the upper Araguaya as far as Leopoldina, the port for
Goyaz capital. Several Englishmen and Germans and
very many Brazilians had travelled on that river, where
even military posts had at one time been established
at intervals on its banks.</p>

<p>So that, rather than be imposed upon and travel
for hundreds of kilometres in so well-known a region,
I decided slightly to alter my route in order to cover
ground that was newer and infinitely more interesting
and important.</p>

<p>The Presidente's friend, the highly revered Colonel,
had also undertaken to purchase a number of horses
and mules for me. "The people of Goyaz," said he,
"are terrible thieves; they will swindle you if you
buy them yourself. I will purchase them for you and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-122" id="Pg_1-122"></a>[<a href="./images/1-122.png">122</a>]</span>
you will then pay me back the money. By to-morrow
morning," he had stated, "I shall have all the horses
and mules you require."</p>

<p>This was on the day of my arrival in Goyaz. Twelve
days after that date he appeared with a famished,
skeleton-like horse&mdash;only one&mdash;for which he made me
pay nearly double what I had myself paid for other
excellent animals.</p>

<p>I took care after that experience to beware of the
"revered and honest men of Goyaz." Those who
behaved honestly were generally those who were described
as thieves. Everything is reversed in Brazil,
and I should have known better.</p>

<p>Let us have a look around the city. Mules and
horses were grazing in the principal square on a severe
slope; the streets were paved in a fashion calculated
to dislocate your feet or possibly break them if you
happened to be walking out after dark. There was
not the slightest semblance of drainage in any part of
the town. The people flung out into the streets all
that could be flung out, and also a good deal that
should not be flung. The dirt was excessive all over
the place when the rain did not come to the rescue and
wash it all off.</p>

<p>The boast of the town was its brilliant illumination&mdash;one
hundred petroleum lights all told, lighted up
until ten p.m. when there was no moon. When there
was, or should have been, a moon, as on stormy nights,
the municipality economized on the paraffin and the
lamps were not lighted. I do not know anything more
torturing than returning home every night after my
dinner at the palace, walking on the slippery, worn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-123" id="Pg_1-123"></a>[<a href="./images/1-123.png">123</a>]</span>
slabs of stone of the pavements, at all angles&mdash;some
were even vertical&mdash;in the middle of the road. You
stumbled, slipped, twisted your feet, jamming them
in the wide interstices between the slabs. I never
could understand why the municipality troubled to
have lights at all. They gave no light when they were
lighted&mdash;not enough to see by them&mdash;and they were
absolutely of no use to the natives themselves. By
eight o'clock p.m. all the people were asleep and barricaded
within their homes.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;can you believe it?&mdash;in this medi&aelig;val city
you would be talked about considerably and would give
much offence if you went out of your house in clothes
such as you would wear in England in the country.
On Sundays and during all Easter week&mdash;when I was
there&mdash;all the men went out in their frock-coats, top
hats of grotesquely antiquated shapes, extra high
starched collars, and, above all, patent leather shoes&mdash;with
the sun scorching overhead. The women were
amusing enough in their finery&mdash;which had been perhaps
the fashion elsewhere fifty or sixty or more years ago.
But they believed they were as well-dressed and quite as
up-to-date as the smartest women of Paris or London.
They never let an opportunity pass of telling you so.</p>

<p>The most striking building in the principal square
of Goyaz was the prison. I visited it in the company
of the Chief of Police. The place had been specially
cleaned on the occasion of my visit, and that particular
day it looked quite neat. I was shown very
good food which&mdash;at least that day&mdash;had been prepared
for the prisoners. Nearly all the prisoners were murderers.
"But the biggest criminals of all," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-124" id="Pg_1-124"></a>[<a href="./images/1-124.png">124</a>]</span>
Chief of Police to me, "are not inside this prison;
they are outside!" The poor devils inside were mere
wretches who had not been able to bribe the judges.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, petty theft was considered a shame
in the Province of Goyaz, and was occasionally severely
punished; whereas murderers were usually set free.
I saw a poor negro there who had stolen a handful of
beans and had been sent to five years' penal servitude,
while others who had killed were merely sentenced to
a few months' punishment. In any case, no one in
Brazil can be sentenced to more than thirty years'
detention, no matter how terrible the crime he has
committed.</p>

<p>The display of police guarding the prison was somewhat
excessive. There were fifty policemen to guard
fifty prisoners: policemen standing at each door,
policemen at each corner of the building, while a swarm
of them occupied the front hall. The various common
cells were entered by trap doors in the ceiling, of great
height, and by a ladder which was let down. Thus
escape was rendered improbable, the iron bars of the
elevated windows being sounded every morning and
night for further safety.</p>

<p>The sanitary arrangements were of the most primitive
kind, a mere bucket in a corner serving the needs
of eight or ten men in each chamber.</p>

<p>As there was no lunatic asylum in Goyaz, insane
people were sent to prison and were kept and treated
like criminals.</p>

<p>I noticed several interesting cases of insanity: it
generally took either a religious or a criminal form
in Brazil. One man, with a ghastly degenerate face,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-125" id="Pg_1-125"></a>[<a href="./images/1-125.png">125</a>]</span>
and his neck encircled by a heavy iron collar, was
chained to the strong bars of a window. His hands
and feet were also chained. The chain at his neck
was so short that he could only move a few inches away
from the iron bars. He sat crouched like a vicious
dog on the window-ledge, howling and spitting at us
as we passed. His clothes were torn to shreds; his
eyes were sunken and staring, his long, thin, sinewy
arms, with hands which hung as if dead, occasionally
and unconsciously touching this or that near them.
I tried to get close, to talk and examine him; but his
fury was so great against the policeman who accompanied
me that it was impossible to get near. He
was trying to bite like a mad dog, and injured himself
in his efforts to get at us. Another lunatic, too&mdash;loose
in a chamber with other prisoners&mdash;gave a wonderful
exhibition of fury&mdash;that time against me, as he was
under the impression that I had come there to kill
him! He was ready to spring at me when two policemen
seized him and drove him back.</p>

<p>There was a theatre in Goyaz&mdash;a rambling shed of
no artistic pretensions. The heat inside that building
was stifling. When I inquired why there were no
windows to ventilate the place I was told that a leading
Goyaz gentleman, having once travelled to St. Petersburg
in Russia in winter-time, and having seen there
a theatre with no windows, eventually returned to his
native city, and immediately had all the windows of
the theatre walled up, regardless of the fact that what
is suitable in a semi-arctic climate is hardly fit for a
stifling tropical country.</p>

<p>One thing that struck me most in Goyaz was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-126" id="Pg_1-126"></a>[<a href="./images/1-126.png">126</a>]</span>
incongruity of the people. With the little literature
which found its way so far in the interior, most of the
men professed advanced social and religious ideas, the
majority making pretence of atheism in a very acute
form. "Down with faith: down with religion: down
with the priests!" was their cry.</p>

<p>Yet, much to my amazement&mdash;I was there in Easter
week&mdash;one evening there was a religious procession
through the town. What did I see? All those fierce
atheists, with bare, penitent heads stooping low,
carrying lighted candles and wooden images of our
crucified Saviour and the Virgin! The procession was
extremely picturesque, the entire population, dressed
up for the occasion, being out in the streets that night,
while all the men, including the policemen and federal
soldiers&mdash;all bareheaded&mdash;walked meekly along in the
procession, each carrying a candle. When the procession
arrived at the church, the Presidente himself&mdash;another
atheist&mdash;respectfully attended the service; then
the priest came out and delivered a spirited sermon
to the assembled crowds in the square. Then you saw
those atheists&mdash;old and young, civil and military&mdash;again
kneeling on the hard and irregular paving-stones&mdash;some
had taken the precaution to spread their handkerchiefs
so as not to soil their trousers&mdash;and beating
their chests and murmuring prayers, and shaking their
heads in sign of repentance.</p>

<p>Such is the world! The prettiest part of the procession
was that formed by the young girls, all garbed
in immaculate white, and with jet-black hair&mdash;masses
of it&mdash;hanging loose upon their shoulders. The chanting
was musical and the whole affair most impressive.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-127" id="Pg_1-127"></a>[<a href="./images/1-127.png">127</a>]</span>
I had received somewhat of a shock in the morning
on passing the principal church&mdash;there were five or
six in Goyaz. Spread out upon the pavement was the
life-size wooden figure of our Saviour&mdash;which had
evidently long been stored in a damp cellar&mdash;much
mildewed and left there in the sun in preparation for
the evening performance. The red wig of real hair,
with its crown of thorns, had been removed and was
drying upon a convenient neighbouring shrub! Really,
those people of Goyaz were an amusing mixture of
simplicity and superstition.</p>

<p>One great redeeming point of the people of Goyaz
was that they were extremely charitable. They had
erected a huge building as a workhouse. It was entirely
supported by charity. A small library had also been
established.</p>

<p>As I have elsewhere stated, I needed for my expedition
no less than thirty men, so that they could, if
necessary, carry all my instruments, cameras, provisions,
ammunition, etc., where animals could not get through.</p>

<p>Fourteen long and tedious days elapsed in Goyaz.
No one could be induced to come. In despair I sent
a despatch to the Minister of Agriculture, asking for
the loan of at least four soldiers&mdash;whom I should naturally
have paid out of my own pocket, as I had duly
explained to the Presidente, who backed my request.
To my regret I received a reply from the Minister of
War saying that at that moment the Government
could not possibly spare four soldiers. It must be
said that, although the men of Goyaz did not shine
for their bravery, it was not so with the ladies, several
of whom offered, if necessary, to accompany the ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-128" id="Pg_1-128"></a>[<a href="./images/1-128.png">128</a>]</span>pedition
and do, of course, the work of the men. I
believe that they meant it.</p>

<p>I have, indeed, the greatest respect and admiration for
the noble self-sacrifice of the women of Goyaz. Devoted
mothers and wives, to men who deserved no devotion
at all&mdash;nearly all the men had concubines&mdash;gentle,
humble, thoughtful, simple and hard-working, they
did all the work in the house. They were a great
contrast to the lazy, conceited, vain male portion of
the population. Certainly, in a population of 10,000
people, I met two or three men who deserved respect,
but they were the exception.</p>

<p>If the men were so timid, it was not altogether their
fault; they could not help it. It was enough to look
at them to see that no great feats of bravery could
be expected of them. They were under-developed, exhausted,
eaten up by the most terrible complaint of
the blood. The lives in which they merely vegetated
were without any mental stimulus. Many suffered
from go&icirc;tre, others had chests that were pitiful to look
at, so under-developed were they; all continually
complained, every time you spoke to them, of headache,
toothache, backache, or some other ache. They
were always dissatisfied with life and with the world
at large, and had no energy whatever to try and improve
their condition. They were extremely polite;
they had a conventional code of good manners, to which,
they adhered faithfully&mdash;but that was all.</p>

<p class="fsc">Some of Author's Pack Animals.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the end of the fourteen days in Goyaz I had
been able to purchase a good number of mules and
horses&mdash;at a very high price, as the people would
not otherwise part with their quadrupeds. Also I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-129" id="Pg_1-129"></a>[<a href="./images/1-129.png">129</a>]</span>
had collected all the riding and pack saddles and harness
necessary, a sufficient quantity of spare shoes for the
animals, a number of large saws, axes, picks and spades,
large knives for cutting our way through the forest, and
every possible implement necessary on a journey of
the kind I was about to undertake. Everything was
ready&mdash;except the men!</p>

<p>Alcides Ferreiro do Santos and Filippe da Costa de
Britto&mdash;the two men lent me by Mr. Louis Schnoor in
Araguary&mdash;upon seeing my plight were at last induced
to accompany the expedition at a salary of close upon
a pound sterling a day each.</p>

<p>At the last moment the Presidente came to my
rescue. He supplied me with six men.</p>

<p>"They are criminals," he said to me, "and they
will give you no end of trouble"&mdash;a fact fully
demonstrated three hours later that same evening,
when one of them&mdash;an ex-policeman&mdash;disappeared
for ever with a few pounds sterling I had advanced
him in order to purchase clothes. Another fellow
vanished later, carrying away some 40 lb. of coffee,
sugar, knives, and other sundries. So then I had two
criminals less.</p>

<p>I packed my animals, and was about to depart with
the four remaining rascals and the two Araguary men&mdash;six
all told&mdash;when a policeman, sent in haste, called
me to the Palace. The truly good-hearted Presidente
and his charming family were in a great state of mind.
They told me that my men had gone about the town
the previous night drinking, and had confided to friends
that they were merely coming with me in order to
murder and rob me of all I possessed as soon as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-130" id="Pg_1-130"></a>[<a href="./images/1-130.png">130</a>]</span>
had an opportunity. It was an open secret that I
carried a very large sum of money upon my person,
as after leaving S&atilde;o Paulo city it was impossible to
obtain money by cashing cheques on letters of credit
or other such civilized means, and it was imperative
for me to carry several thousand pounds sterling in
cash in order to be able to purchase horses, mules,
boats, food, and pay the men, as long as the journey
should last.</p>

<p>When you stop to consider that I had before me
the prospect of not replenishing my exchequer for at
least one year, or perhaps two years or more, it will
be easily understood that if one wants to travel, and
travel quickly as I do, there is no other possible way
than to carry the money with one in hard cash. The
risk was certainly enormous, although no one except
myself ever really knew the amount that I actually
carried. A large portion of that sum was in Brazilian
notes, a good deal in English bank-notes, and some four
hundred pounds sterling in English gold. As I could
trust nobody, that sum, except what I gradually spent,
and barring the few moments when I took my daily morning
bath, never left my person, even for a few minutes,
for the entire period of one year. Most of the notes
were contained in two bulky leather bags and the gold
in a third, attached firmly to a strong belt which day
and night&mdash;much to my discomfort&mdash;encircled my
waist. The larger bank-notes, letters of credit, etc.,
were divided into my various coat, shirt, and trousers
pockets. The gold was so heavy that it caused with
its friction a large sore on my right hip&mdash;a sore which
remained there more or less for an entire year.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-131" id="Pg_1-131"></a>[<a href="./images/1-131.png">131</a>]</span>
"You cannot start under such conditions," said
the Presidente appealingly. "I cannot furnish other
men. No one will go, notwithstanding the high pay
you give them."</p>

<p>I thanked the Presidente for his exquisite kindness,
and for the very generous and thoughtful hospitality
he and his delightful family had offered me in Goyaz,
and which left in my mind the only pleasant moments
spent in that dull city.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Departure&mdash;Devoured by Insects</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> minutes later I had again joined my caravan,
watched intently, at a respectful distance, by a few
astonished natives of Goyaz. As soon as all my mules and
horses had been packed&mdash;they were very heavily laden&mdash;I
took my departure in a direction north-west by west.
The six men mounted on mules came along. I had armed
all my followers with the best repeating carbines that are
made, as well as with excellent automatic pistols, and
the long daggers locally used; but personally I carried
no weapons of any kind.</p>

<p>Having been unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient men
from the officials of Goyaz, there yet remained for me one
last faint hope. It was to try and get a few followers
from the Indian colony of the Salesian friars, a few
days' journey west of the Araguaya River.</p>

<p>On April 26th, from the height of Santa Barbara
(elev. 2,150 ft. above the sea level), a picturesque
chapel and graveyard to the west of the city, I bade
good-bye for good to Goyaz capital (elev. 1,950 ft.).
One obtained from this point a fine view of the entire
city spreading from north to south, at the bottom of
the imposing frame of mountains on the south with
their extraordinary columnar formation. Each natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-133" id="Pg_1-133"></a>[<a href="./images/1-133.png">133</a>]</span>
column, with its mineral composition and crystallization,
shone like silver in the bright light. The <i>ensemble</i>
from our point of vantage resembled the set of pipes
of an immense church organ. High hills stood to the
east. In the distance to the south-west the lower
country was open with the exception of mountains in
the far background.</p>

<p>We marched rapidly enough across wooded country
until we crossed the Rio Vermelho (elev. 1,750 ft.).
My men became very excited and began firing their
carbines recklessly. I had handed to them fifty cartridges
each, with strict instructions not to fire without
my orders. I was some distance off. When I heard
the fusillade I immediately galloped to the spot. The
men had blazed away nearly all their ammunition, nor
would they cease firing when I ordered them until
they had exhausted their supply of 300 cartridges in
all. Why were they firing? Because, said they, they
had crossed the first water on their journey.</p>

<p>My heart absolutely sank into my boots when I
realized that it was my fate to travel with such contemptible
imbeciles for perhaps a year longer or more,
and that was only the first day! Oh, what a prospect!
We had our first quarrel when the men demanded to
have their belts replenished with cartridges for their
protection against attack. As I refused to let them
have them there was a mutiny, the men declining to go
on another yard unless the cartridges were handed to
them. We had not been gone more than three hours, and
a mutiny already! With a great deal of patience I induced
them to go on, which they eventually did with oaths
and language somewhat unpleasant. Still I held firm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-134" id="Pg_1-134"></a>[<a href="./images/1-134.png">134</a>]</span>
After several ascents and descents and a great many
mishaps with our mules, unaccustomed yet to the
work, we made camp, having marched 18 kil., on the
bank of the Rio Agapa (elev. 1,650 ft.), near which
the grazing was fair.</p>

<p>Two mules escaped during the night, and we could
only make a late start the next morning. Alcides traced
them all the way back to Goyaz, where he recovered
them. Up and down we went, from 1,760 ft. to
1,550 ft., at which elevation we crossed the Rio Indio
with a beautiful rocky bed the banks of which showed
strata of red and grey clay and delicious crystalline
water. No fossils of any kind were to be seen anywhere,
although I looked hard in search of them all the time.
The country was undulating and fairly thickly wooded
near streams, otherwise it consisted mostly of campos,
at the highest point of which another beautiful panoramic
view of the escarpment in the plateau we had left
behind could be obtained. The elevation was constantly
changing between 1,750 ft. and 2,050 ft. above
the sea level. Burity and other palms were plentiful.
We crossed that day three streams, the last one the
Rio Uva.</p>

<p>In a distance of 38 kil. we saw only a miserable
shed, although we passed a site where a ruined house
and paddock showed that once there must have been
quite an ancient and important farm. Yes, indeed,
Goyaz State had seen better days in the time of the
Emperor and when slavery was legal. With the
present lack of population and the prohibitive prices
of labour it was impossible to carry on farming profitably.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-135" id="Pg_1-135"></a>[<a href="./images/1-135.png">135</a>]</span>
The landscape was everywhere beautiful, but one
never saw a bird, never perceived a butterfly, nor any
other animal life of any kind. I was just remarking
this fact to Alcides when a snake, eight or nine feet
long, crossed at a great speed in front of my mule.
The mules and horses were rather frightened at first
of snakes, and it was amusing to watch how high they
stepped when they saw them and tried to escape from
them. We were in great luck. A flock of six beautiful
red <i>araras</i> (macaws) passed above our heads. They
looked perfectly gorgeous as they flapped their wings
heavily and shrieked loudly as they sped along.</p>

<p>The formation of the soil in that region was interesting
enough. Under a greyish white surface layer
there were thin sedimentary strata of pebbles, deposited
evidently by water, then under these a thick stratum&mdash;30
ft. or more&mdash;of warm-coloured red earth. The
streams which had cut their way through this geological
formation were invariably limpid in the extreme.</p>

<p>We were beginning to find beautiful flowers and
butterflies again, the latter in great swarms near the
water.</p>

<p>My caravan of grey and white pack-animals&mdash;some
fourteen&mdash;was quite a picturesque sight as it wound its
way down steep hill-sides, the mounted men urging the
mules with shouts and lashes from their whips. We
experienced difficulty in finding a good camp that night,
the grazing being poor and the water scarce when
sunset came. It seemed a pity that the most suitable
camping places were not always to be found when you
wished to halt!</p>

<p>We were now at an elevation of 1,550 ft. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-136" id="Pg_1-136"></a>[<a href="./images/1-136.png">136</a>]</span>
we proceeded the next morning we found nothing
of interest. Fairly wooded country alternated with
campos, at first rather undulating, then almost flat,
until we arrived at the Tapirapuana River (elev.
1,350 ft.), 8 yards wide and 3 ft. deep, which we crossed
without much trouble, in the afternoon, at a spot some
28 kil. distant from our last camp. Luxuriant foliage
hung over the banks right down into the water, which
flowed so slowly&mdash;only at the rate of 1,080 metres an
hour&mdash;that it looked almost stagnant, and of a muddy,
dirty, greenish colour.</p>

<p>We were much troubled by mosquitoes, flies and
<i>carrapatinhos</i>, the latter a kind of tiny little clinging
parasite which swarmed absolutely all over us every
time we put our feet on the ground on dismounting from
our animals. The irritation was such that you actually
drove your nails into your skin in scratching yourself.
They could only be driven away by smearing oneself
all over with tobacco juice, the local remedy, or with
strong carbolic soap, which I generally used, and which
worked even more satisfactorily.</p>

<p>A tubercular leper came to spend the evening in
our camp. He was most repulsive, with his enlarged
features, especially the nose, of a ghastly, shiny, unwholesome,
greenish white, and pitifully swollen feet
and hands.</p>

<p>The heat was not unbearable in that region&mdash;89&deg;
Fahrenheit in the shade, 105&deg; in the sun. There was a
breeze blowing that day from the north-east, with a
velocity of 200 metres a minute by anemometer.</p>

<p>A good portion of the following day was wasted
trying to recover four animals that had escaped. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-137" id="Pg_1-137"></a>[<a href="./images/1-137.png">137</a>]</span>
order that they might graze properly it was necessary
to let them loose. They sometimes strayed away long
distances. Occasionally they hid in the shade of the
<i>matto</i> (forest and shrub), and it was easy to miss them
while looking for them. Luckily, two of my men&mdash;Alcides
and a man called Antonio&mdash;were excellent
trackers, and sooner or later they were generally able
to bring back the animals, which was not at all difficult,
as one only had to follow the marks of their hoofs
to find where they had gone.</p>

<p>We departed late in the afternoon through thick
shrub, over marked undulations&mdash;in some spots quite
steep. From the highest point that day (elev. 1,900 ft.)
we obtained an extensive view of flat tablelands in
the distance to the east, with a low hill-range standing
in front of them. It was scenery quite typical of
Central Brazil, with no irregular, striking mountains;
but everywhere we had plenty to study in the effects
of erosion on that great continent.</p>

<p>I tried to make up for time lost by marching at
night&mdash;a most trying experience, as my men, unaccustomed
to the work and frightened at every shadow,
let the mules stray in all directions. I unfortunately
had to hand over to my followers a few cartridges each,
or else they would not come on. Every now and then
that night they fired recklessly in the dark&mdash;much to
the danger of beasts and men alike&mdash;thinking they had
seen an Indian, or a leopard, or some other wild animal.
I was glad when we arrived in camp and ascertained
that no one had been wounded.</p>

<p>That night-march demoralized animals and men
alike. Most of the animals strayed away during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-138" id="Pg_1-138"></a>[<a href="./images/1-138.png">138</a>]</span>
night, as the grazing was bad where we halted. I was
compelled to halt for two days in that miserable spot,
simply devoured by flies and mosquitoes and <i>carrapatos</i>,
in order to recover them.</p>

<p>If you do not know what a <i>carrapato</i> is, let me tell
you. It is an insect of the order of Diptera and the
genus <i>Mosca pupiparas</i>, and is technically known as
<i>Melophagus ovinus</i>. Its flattened, almost circular
body varies in size from the head of an ordinary nail
to the section of a good-sized pencil. Like the <i>carrapatinho</i>&mdash;its
miniature reproduction&mdash;it possesses wonderful
clinging powers, its legs with hook attachment
actually entering under the skin. Its chief delight
consists in inserting its head right under your cutaneous
tissues, wherefrom it can suck your blood with
convenient ease. It is wonderfully adept at this, and
while I was asleep, occasionally as many as eight or ten
of these brutes were able to settle down comfortably
to their work without my noticing them; and some&mdash;and
it speaks highly for their ability&mdash;were even able
to enter my skin (in covered parts of the body) in the
day-time when I was fully awake, without my detecting
them. I believe that previous to inserting the head
they must inject some poison which deadens the sensitiveness
of the skin. It is only after they have been
at work some hours that a slight itching causes their
detection. Then comes the difficulty of extracting
them. If in a rash moment you seize the carrapato
by the body and pull, its head becomes separated from
its body and remains under your skin, poisoning it
badly and eventually causing unpleasant sores. Having
been taught the proper process of extraction, I, like all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-139" id="Pg_1-139"></a>[<a href="./images/1-139.png">139</a>]</span>
my men, carried on my person a large pin. When the
carrapato was duly located&mdash;it is quite easy to see it,
as the large body remains outside&mdash;the pin was duly
pushed right through its body. The carrapato, thus
surprised, at once let go with its clinging legs, which
struggled pitifully in the air. Then with strong tobacco
juice or liquefied carbolic soap, or iodine, you smeared
all round the place where the head was still inserted.
The unpleasantness of these various beverages immediately
persuaded the brute to withdraw its head at
once. You could then triumphantly wave the pin and
struggling carrapato in the air. You were liberated
from the unpleasant visitor. It was not uncommon
while you were extracting one&mdash;the operation took
some little time&mdash;for two or three others to find
their way into your legs or body. I fortunately
possess blood which does not easily get poisoned, and
felt no ill effects from the hundreds of these brutes
which fed on me during the entire journey; but many
people suffer considerably. My men, for instance, had
nasty-looking sores produced by the bites of the carrapato.
The mules and horses were simply swarming
with these insects, which gave them no end of trouble,
especially as they selected the tenderest parts of the
skin in various localities of the body to settle upon.
Where an animal had a sore it would soon be swarming
with carrapatos near its edge. It would then putrefy,
and maggots in hundreds would be produced inside the
wound almost within a few hours.</p>

<p>There was, near by, an old <i>moradoria</i>, a large
patch of <i>muricy</i> trees (<i>Byrsonima</i>), of which various
species exist. These were not unlike small olive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-140" id="Pg_1-140"></a>[<a href="./images/1-140.png">140</a>]</span>
trees and produced a small sweet fruit quite good to
eat.</p>

<p>We went for 22 kil. through a forest with beautiful
fan palms over 30 ft. high. There was no animal life.
We crossed three streamlets, the country between
being undulating. Between the last two streams we
came across rock showing through the alluvial deposits.
It was an interesting conglomerate of minute crystals
cemented together by hardened clay, the whole forming
large blocks.</p>

<p>More trouble was in store for us. One of my mules
was seriously injured. Its spine was so badly strained
that it was quite disabled for further work. My cook,
who had a slight attack of indigestion, wished to be
left there to die, and declined to proceed any farther.
With true Brazilian reasoning he wished, nevertheless,
to be paid off before dying. With true English
reasoning I explained to him that money would be of
little use to him in the next world. If he really
intended to die I would certainly not pay him, but
his wages would naturally go on while he was alive,
continued the journey, and did the cooking. He
quickly returned to life, and to his senses.</p>

<p>Really, in the entire experiences of my travels I
have never come across more pitiable specimens of
manhood than those fellows. They absolutely gave me
a sickly feeling that I never lost while they were with
me, for many many months to come. The animals,
too, were almost as bad as the men. They had little
endurance, they had no courage, everything seemed to
affect them. The worst Abyssinian mule, for instance,
was, for equal work, vastly superior to the best Goyaz<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-141" id="Pg_1-141"></a>[<a href="./images/1-141.png">141</a>]</span>
mule. It was a useless task to try and train those
animals. On my many previous expeditions I had
been able to win the affection of my animals, and was
able to train them in a few days so that they obeyed
with the perfection of soldiers, but in Brazil, the last day
I had them&mdash;after several months that they had been
with me&mdash;they were just as disobedient and stupid
as on the first day. In fact, they never even seemed
to recognize us again. They had learnt absolutely
nothing, except bad habits. Everything seemed to
frighten them. One mule, for instance, was afraid of
crossing small streams. Its legs invariably began to
quiver on entering the water, and down would go mule
and baggage rolling into the water. All the thrashing
in the world could not make it get up. We had to
drag the brute bodily across the stream, when it would
jump up on its legs again. It was quite futile to try and
prevent that animal collapsing every time it had to go
across water. So that, on approaching any streamlet,
we had to unload it in order at least to prevent the
baggage getting soaked.</p>

<p>The interior of Brazil&mdash;even comparatively near a
city, as we were still to Goyaz&mdash;did not compare in
civilization with the lowest and poorest countries of
Central Asia or Africa. Humble countries like Persia
and Beluchistan or Abyssinia some ten or fifteen years
ago were more advanced than Brazil to-day. They
had good trails on which a regular postal service was
established, there were regular rest-houses on those
trails, and horses or camels could easily be hired and
exchanged at the different stations, so that one could
travel comparatively quickly. It was not so in Brazil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-142" id="Pg_1-142"></a>[<a href="./images/1-142.png">142</a>]</span>
Even if you wished to take a short journey of a few
days from a city, you had to purchase your horses
or your mules, and have the riding and pack saddles
made for you at a high cost.</p>

<p>As we have seen, even in the city of Goyaz itself,
there did not exist a single hotel, nor did we find a
proper rest-house in the 531 kil. between the railway
terminus and Goyaz capital. Nor is there one of
these conveniences west between Goyaz and Cuyaba,
the capital of Matto Grosso. Of course there were no
hotels because nobody travelled, but it can also be
said that many people do not care to travel where
there are no hotels. In so humble and poor a country
as Persia you always could indulge in a delicious bath
in every caravanserai, which you found in the remotest
spots all over the country. In Brazil you have to
resort to the streams, where the moment you remove
your clothes you are absolutely devoured by mosquitoes,
flies and insects of all kinds&mdash;a perfect torture, I can
assure you. Once you were in the water, immersed up
to the mouth, it took a brave man to come out again,
as millions of mosquitoes and flies and gnats circled
angrily and greedily above your head ready for the
attack the moment you came out.</p>

<p>We were travelling all the time at elevations varying
from 1,450 ft. at our last camp to 1,400 ft. at our
present camp, the highest elevation between these two
places being on a rocky hillock about 100 ft. higher
than those altitudes.</p>

<p>Our camp was on a streamlet flowing from south
to north, of milky water containing lime, which made
our tongues and gums smart when we drank it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-143" id="Pg_1-143"></a>[<a href="./images/1-143.png">143</a>]</span>
Again on May 3rd we went through forest all the
time, with wonderful palms and many medicinal plants.
Alcides had an extensive knowledge of the curative
qualities of the various plants. Various species of the
<i>Caroba</i> (<i>Bignoniace&aelig;</i>), very beneficial, they say, as a
blood purifier, especially in the worst of terrible complaints,
were plentiful there. Giant nettles, the <i>Ortiga</i>
or <i>Cassausan</i>, as it is locally called, were also frequently
noticeable, especially when we passed too near and
were stung all over by them.</p>

<p>We had risen to 1,200 ft. on the summit of a range
called O Fogo. From it we had another exquisite
view of the mountain range called Bucainha, which
we had left behind to the east. It had a marked
erosion on its north side.</p>

<p>On the west side of the pass we found curious small
domes as well as pillars and other rocks of columnar
formation. We had met during the day many <i>Aricori</i>
palms, which, I was told, produced a sweet fruit
excellent to eat when ripe, in the month of November.</p>

<p>After a steep rocky descent we made our camp.
We halted earlier than usual. I was sitting outside
my tent while my dinner was being cooked. I could
not help smiling at the warlike array which had been
necessary in order to make a start from Goyaz. The
camp was a regular armoury. Beautiful magazine
rifles, now rusty and dirty owing to the carelessness
of the men, were lying about on the ground; revolvers
and automatic pistols stuck half out of their slings on
the men's belts as they walked about the camp; large
knives and daggers had been thrown about, and so had
the huge, heavy, nickel-plated spurs of the men, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-144" id="Pg_1-144"></a>[<a href="./images/1-144.png">144</a>]</span>
their gigantic spiked wheels. These wheels were as
much as two inches in diameter and even more. It was
the habit of Brazilians to wear the spurs upside down,
so that when they got off their mounts they had to
remove them or it would have been impossible for them
to walk. Naturally, worn like that, they were much
more effective, and were intended to torment the
animals with greater success.</p>

<p>I reprimanded the men for keeping their weapons
so dirty. One man thereupon sat himself three feet
away from me and proceeded to clean his rifle,
keeping the muzzle pointed constantly at me. On my
suggesting that he might point the weapon in another
direction he roughly replied the usual thing: "There
is nothing to be afraid of, it is not loaded"&mdash;and
he proceeded to pull the trigger, the gun pointed
straight at me, when I leapt up and snatched it
out of his hands. There was a cartridge in the barrel
and several cartridges in the magazine.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-144.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-144_th.jpg" alt="Author's Caravan across the Immense Prairies of Matto Grosso." title="Author's Caravan across the Immense Prairies of Matto Grosso." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Author's Caravan across the Immense Prairies of Matto Grosso.</p>
<hr />
<p>During the night the fusillade was constant. It was
enough for the men to hear a leaf fall. Immediately
there was an alarm and the rifles were fired. Once or
twice the bullets came so unpleasantly near me that
I suspected they were intended for me. I thanked
my stars that my men were bad shots. To make sure
of this fact, I one day had a shooting competition.
After that I became quite assured that it was sufficient
to be at the spot where they aimed to consider myself
in absolute safety. It was not so, of course, when they
aimed somewhere else. I did not care to take away
the cartridges from them altogether, as they would have
then imagined that I was afraid of them&mdash;an impres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-145" id="Pg_1-145"></a>[<a href="./images/1-145.png">145</a>]</span>sion
which it would have been fatal to let them entertain
even for a moment. Each man was allowed to
replenish his belt each day to the extent of ten cartridges.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere referred to the absurd pack-saddles
used in Brazil, so heavy and unsteady when going over
rough country, with the underpads so difficult to adjust
that the animals were soon a mass of sores on the back,
the sides of the body, on the chest and tail. I had
other lighter and more sensible saddles, but I had to
discard them as the Brazilians would not hear of
using them, and I gave up in despair of teaching them
how to pack them. I eventually left those saddles
behind.</p>

<p>The riding-saddles, too, were almost as absurd as
the pack-saddles, constructed as they were of innumerable
and useless pieces of wood, iron and leather.
The stirrups were gaudy, and consisted of a regular
shoe of silver or other metal, into which you inserted
the greater part of your foot, or else of a much ornamented
circular ring. The head-piece and bit were
also extremely heavy, clumsy, and highly decorated,
for everything must be made for show if it had to be
used in Brazil.</p>

<p>It was not possible to associate in any way or be
friendly with my men. They were unpleasant beyond
all conception. One could not say a word&mdash;no matter
how kind&mdash;without the prospect of a long argument or
a row. It was quite beyond them to be civil, and,
like all ignorant people, they always imagined that
they could teach others everything&mdash;including good
manners! They were ridiculously courteous to one
another&mdash;a muleteer talking to another always address<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-146" id="Pg_1-146"></a>[<a href="./images/1-146.png">146</a>]</span>ing
him as "Sir," and referring to his comrades as his
"colleagues."</p>

<p>We travelled that day nearly altogether over finely
powdered reddish earth of volcanic origin. I had so
far not met with a single fossil, not a shell, not a petrified
bone of any animal, nor, indeed, impressions on rock
of leaves, twigs or other parts of plants. The farther
one went on, the more one had proof that that portion
at least of the American continent had never been
submerged in its entirety.</p>

<p>Some rocks displayed on the surface peculiar perforations
such as would be produced by incessant water
dripping over them, but these were caused, I think, merely
by water falling over them while they were in a molten
state; other rocks were thoroughly polished on the
surface, as if sand or other gritty substance had flowed
with great force over them, mixed with water&mdash;perhaps
during a period of volcanic activity and torrential rains.</p>

<p>Geological research was somewhat difficult for a
passing traveller in that region, for everything was
smothered in vegetation. Only here and there in the
cuts of rivers was I able to judge a little better of the
actual formation of the land.</p>

<p>We camped on the stream Agua Limpa, which duly
deserved its name of "clear water" (elev. 1,470 ft.). It
flowed south. On May 4th, going through forest again
over a hill (elev. 1,650 ft.), we obtained a glorious view
of the immense expanse to the west and to the south-west&mdash;a
great stretch of greenish, long sweeping lines
with a plateau in the background. A somewhat taller
hill rose at one end of it. We then descended to another
deliciously clear river, which deserved as well as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-147" id="Pg_1-147"></a>[<a href="./images/1-147.png">147</a>]</span>
previous one the name of Agua Limpa (elev. 1,450 ft.),
but this one flowed north into the Rio Claro. The
land was fine, sparsely wooded all the time, absolutely
flat, but getting slightly undulating beyond that
stream. It seemed wonderful land for agricultural
purposes.</p>

<p>After passing the Indain River, the Bom Successo,
and another stream, all three flowing south, we swerved
more to the north-west, rising up on an elevated spot,
from which we obtained another glorious panorama,
a high Serra to the west, another in the distance to
the east, the two extending almost parallel towards
the south, where the gap in the horizon line between
these ranges was filled by a very distant range showing
a conical peak, and to the west of this another in the
shape of a dome. It was the grandeur of these panoramas
that impressed one most, rather than their
monotonous beauty.</p>

<p>All the outlines of the scenery of Central Brazil
had, so to speak, been worn smooth by the erosive
action of water and wind, so that no fantastically
shaped mountains had yet been encountered, no
landscape which some great commotion had rendered
strangely picturesque. There, only the steady work
of uncountable ages showed itself in a most impressive
way to those who understood. From a striking pictorial
point of view very little remained in one's mind
of those wonderful scenes after one had turned one's
head away, except, perhaps, their immensity and the
deep green tones&mdash;the two salient points of the scenery.</p>

<p>When we had descended from the pass (elev. 1,650
ft.) we came to the Rio Tres de Majo, where a hamlet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-148" id="Pg_1-148"></a>[<a href="./images/1-148.png">148</a>]</span>
of three sheds was found. Twenty-eight kilometres
from our last camp we arrived at the Rio Rancheria,
where stood a miserable farm. Both those streams,
at an elevation of 1,300 ft., flowed into the Rio Claro
to the north.</p>

<p>We had the misfortune of halting near the farmhouse,
and suffered tortures from the millions of mosquitoes,
gnats, carrapatos and carrapatinhos which made
that night almost unbearable. I invariably found that
carrapatos and carrapatinhos were more plentiful where
living people or animals were to be found. Near those
dirty farmhouses we were simply swarming all over
with them. My poor animals, owing to the long
marches we had been making, and the terrible pack-saddles,
had sore backs and loins, sore chests. Yet we
could not stop, and the poor things must stand the pain
and strain.</p>

<h2><a name="I_CHAPTER_X" id="I_CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Fishing&mdash;Termites&mdash;The Great Araguaya River</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">An</span> amusing incident happened. A cow chewed up
the coat of one of my men, which was lying on the
ground. In his fury the owner of the coat, on discovering
the misdeed, seized his carbine and fired four
shots at the cow and four at the farmhouse. None of
us could tell where the bullets went. The cow, startled
by the shots, gave a few jumps and kicks, then, absolutely
uninjured, peacefully continued grazing. The
house too remained untouched. Amazing shots my
men were!</p>

<p>Across almost flat country we reached the Rio
Claro&mdash;"the Limpid River" (elev. 1,250 ft. above the
sea level), 200 metres wide, and flowing along a winding
course in a general direction of south-west to north-east.
Wide beaches of sand and fine gravel were to be seen
on the convex or inner curves of its channel. Along
the banks there was luxuriant vegetation, which hung
down and dipped into the water.</p>

<p>Diamonds were to be found in that river. At low
water curious eruptive, highly ferruginous rocks showed
in the river bed, some in the shape of spherical balls
riddled with perforations, as if they had been in a state
of ebullition, others as little pellets of yellow lava, such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-150" id="Pg_1-150"></a>[<a href="./images/1-150.png">150</a>]</span>
as I had before encountered between Araguary and
Goyaz, and which suggested the spluttering of molten
rock suddenly cooled by contact with cold air or water.</p>

<p>We encamped some three kilometres from the Rio
Claro, on the streamlet Arejado, where again we were
devoured by mosquitoes. Although we all had thick
mosquito nets, and although we slept wrapped&mdash;head
and all&mdash;in our respective blankets, the brutes managed
to find their way in and stung us with incredible vigour.
We were fresh blood for them. The irritation caused
by their bites was a torment.</p>

<p>We were now getting closer to the country where
we were to meet the terrible wild Indians, the most
ferocious and cruel cannibals on earth, according to
the accounts heard in Goyaz. My men were already
beginning to lose heart. With the sleepless night due
to the mosquitoes, and the heavy atmosphere caused
by a fast-approaching thunderstorm, they were morose
in the morning. With the exception of Alcides and
the negro Filippe, the others came insolently forward
and refused to go any farther. They shoved the
muzzles of their rifles under my nose; they wished
to be paid up instantly and go back. With a little
patience it was easy to get out of difficulties of that
sort, if you possessed the gift of keeping calm.</p>

<p>Faithful Alcides, who had a fiery temper, seized
his rifle and was about to fire at them, when I took
the weapon from him.</p>

<p>"Do not shoot them, Alcides: these men have
been good (<i>sic</i>) until now because they were in good
health. They are bad now because they are ill. I
will cure them."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-151" id="Pg_1-151"></a>[<a href="./images/1-151.png">151</a>]</span>
And so saying I felt the pulse and forehead of the
astonished rioters.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, these men are very, very ill. They
need medicine. Alcides, get the castor oil&mdash;the large
tin."</p>

<p>I had two kinds of castor oil: one tasteless&mdash;<i>pour
fa&ccedil;on de parler</i>&mdash;for my own use and cases of serious
illness; another in large tins, of the commonest kind,
with an odour that would kill an ox, which I used occasionally
for punishment on my men when they were
disobedient.</p>

<p>Alcides, who quickly entered into the spirit of that
little joke, immediately produced the deadly tin, collecting
upon the ground the four cups belonging to the
strikers. Taking my instructions, he poured some four
ounces of the sickening oil into each cup&mdash;and perhaps
a little more. I handed a cup to each man and saw
that he drank it. They all eventually did so, with
comic grimaces and oaths. The men, I must tell you,
had great faith in my powers as a medicine man. Once
or twice before I had already cured them of insignificant
ailments, and whenever I told them seriously that they
were ill they believed, in their ignorance, that they
were really ill.</p>

<p>This done, and to put them again in a good temper,
I patted them on the back and, handing each of them
a fish-hook and a line, sent them all to fish in the river,
saying that as they were so ill I would delay my departure
until the afternoon.</p>

<p>"That pool, over there," some three hundred yards
distant, I suggested would be an excellent place for them
to fish in. In that direction, as meek as lambs, like so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-152" id="Pg_1-152"></a>[<a href="./images/1-152.png">152</a>]</span>
many naughty children they all went, carrying the lines
away and some <i>toucinho</i> (lard) for bait. Alcides, who
was an enthusiastic fisherman, also went off with a
line, and had good sport. He reported that the other
men lay flat upon their backs most of the time, groaning
and moaning, upon the rocks, basking in the sun
instead of fishing. The castor oil in any case had the
desired effect that the men did not mutiny again for
some time.</p>

<p>We did not leave camp until 2 p.m. The country
was teeming with plants of great medicinal value, such
as the <i>sucupira</i>, which gave a bean much used in Goyaz
to relieve stomach troubles; the <i>algudanzinho</i>, with
its lovely cadmium-yellow cup-shaped flower&mdash;a plant
which was most plentiful in that region, and the root
of which was said to be very beneficial for the worst of
venereal complaints; and also the <i>acaraiba</i>. Many were
the handsome wild flowers we came across, principally
red and yellow; but to my mind they could bear no
comparison with even the ugliest European wild flowers.
They were coarse in shape and crude in colour, and in
their beauty there was the same difference as there
would be between the lovely refined face of an aristocratic
woman and that of a handsome massive peasant
girl.</p>

<p>Water was certainly not lacking in that country.
We crossed the Rio Striminho, then the Rio Stacco
flowing from south-west to north-east into a lagoon
formed by the Rio Claro. We camped on the bank of
the Rio Stacco. The water was delicious.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Araguaya (looking South).</p>
<hr />
<p>The negro Filippe killed a wild boar. My men had
a great time preparing a huge dinner. They absolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-153" id="Pg_1-153"></a>[<a href="./images/1-153.png">153</a>]</span>
gorged themselves. Personally I never touch pig in any
shape or form, as I cannot get over the idea that its
meat is poisonous for any thoroughly healthy person.
It may, of course, not be so to people who are not absolutely
healthy. The very sight and odour of it make
me quite ill, and I fully share the idea of Mahommedans
that the meat&mdash;certainly of tame pigs&mdash;is most
unclean.</p>

<p>As we went on we had good sport, my men taking
the greatest delight in fishing in the rivers on the banks
of which we halted. The travelling was easy over
flat country. We made short marches for some days,
in order to let the animals recover their lost strength.
In the river Las Almas (elev. 1,250 ft.), 20 metres wide
and 3 ft. deep, flowing north-west, we caught a beautiful
<i>pintado</i> fish&mdash;so called because of its spotted appearance.
That fish possessed a huge flat head, with long
feelers, two on the nose&mdash;at the side of the nostrils,
to be accurate&mdash;two under its lower mandible. The
mouth was enormous in comparison with the total
length of the fish, and could be opened at an extraordinarily
wide angle. Inside were most peculiar teeth
in sets of twos, while the mouth was lined with thousands
of hard, tiny sharp points. The eyes were far back
upon the skull. The bony dome of the palate was
divided in the centre, and a similar separation was to
be observed in the centre of the lower jaw, giving thus
a great flexibility to the interior of the mouth. When
measured, the length of the head was exactly one-third
of the length of the entire fish.</p>

<p>Other fish, too, were caught that day, called
<i>mandib&eacute;</i> or <i>fidalgo</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-154" id="Pg_1-154"></a>[<a href="./images/1-154.png">154</a>]</span>
The aspect of the country was gradually changing.
During that day's march we had gone over beautiful
open stretches of grassy land with only a few stunted
trees upon them. <i>Bosquets</i> or tufts of small palms
or other trees were to be seen, raised on small mounds,
showing how the country was gradually wearing itself
down. Nearly each tree was raised on a mound of
grey clay. Some fine specimens of <i>Lexia</i> trees, with
their peculiarly distorted branches, were to be observed.</p>

<p>Those great scavengers of Brazil, the <i>Urubu</i>, of
which two varieties were to be found&mdash;the <i>Urubu
commun</i> (<i>Cathartes atratus</i>) and the <i>Urubu rei</i>
(<i>Cathartes Papa</i>)&mdash;a cross between a vulture and a
crow, were fairly plentiful now that game was more
abundant in the country. They often pierced our ears
with their unmusical shrieks. The <i>urubu</i> belonged to
the vulture family and was found in all tropical South
America. It had black plumage, somewhat shaggy,
with reddish legs and feet, and bluish, almost naked,
head and neck. Like all rapacious birds of its kind, it
lived entirely on dead animals and what refuse it could
find about the country. Near farms these birds were
generally to be seen in great numbers.</p>

<p>We had a delicious breakfast of fish&mdash;really excellent
eating&mdash;which set everybody in a good humour,
and then we proceeded over slight undulations (elev.
1,250 to 1,300 ft.) through forest until we got to the
Ponte Alto (High Bridge) River, so called because...,
there is no bridge whatever there! The Brazilians
are really too delightful in their reasoning; and, mind
you, it is not done with a mischievous sense of the
ludicrous&mdash;indeed no; it is done seriously. The Ponte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-155" id="Pg_1-155"></a>[<a href="./images/1-155.png">155</a>]</span>
Alto stream was, like most of the other watercourses
of that region, wonderfully limpid.</p>

<p>From that point we were in charming open country,
where we could freely breathe the delicious air. Occasionally
we saw some <i>angelin</i> trees (the <i>Angelino
amargoso</i> and <i>Angelino pedra</i>), technically known as
<i>Andira vermifuga</i> M. and <i>Andira spectabilis</i> Sald.</p>

<p>Nearly all the woods we found had a high specific
gravity: the two latter, for instance, 0&middot;984 and 1&middot;052
respectively, and a resistance to crushing of kilos
0&middot;684 and kilos. 0&middot;648.</p>

<p><i>Cacti</i> of great size were numerous. We were now
in a region where termite-hills (ant-hills) were to be seen
in great numbers. They stood from 2 to 3 ft. above
ground, although occasionally some could be seen
nearly double that height. Some of the ant-heaps
were extraordinary in their architecture, and resembled
miniature castles with towers and terraced platforms.
Whether they had been built so by the ants or worn
down to that shape by the pouring rain and wind, was
not so easy to tell.</p>

<p>The more one saw of the termites, the more one
disliked them, for they were the most insidious, destructive
little brutes of that region. They were ugly
in appearance, with their fat white bodies of a dirty
greenish-white colour. Nevertheless one could not
help having great admiration for those little rascals,
which in one night were able to devour the bottom of
stout wooden boxes, and in a few hours damaged saddles,
clothes, shoes, or any article which happened to be
left resting for a little while on the ground. They were
even able to make an entire house tumble down in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-156" id="Pg_1-156"></a>[<a href="./images/1-156.png">156</a>]</span>
comparatively short time if the material used in the
construction were wood.</p>

<p>Yes, one hated them; yet, when one knew all
about them, one had to spend hours watching their
doings with a microscope, it was so interesting. They
seemed to have two social classes among them&mdash;the
labouring class and the warriors. To the labourers
was given the heavy task of digging underground
channels, the surplus earth of which was thrown up
with great force through apertures in the soil until
the earth so displaced and amassed formed a high
heap, riddled in its interior by hundreds of channels
and miniature chambers and apartments. To the
warriors&mdash;really more like a kind of perfect police
service&mdash;was entrusted the safety of the colony and
principally the protection of the young. White ants
have many enemies, especially among the larger ants,
which carry on regular wars against them; for although
ants and termites&mdash;commonly called white ants&mdash;have
many points in common, yet they belong to totally
different orders of insects, as can be easily noticed in
their structure and development. The peculiar structure
of the enlarged heads of the warrior termites was
particularly noticeable. Some had a formidable head
provided with tentacles and powerful rodent clippers&mdash;as
well as the peculiar whitish cuirasses in sections of
the body. The workers had more normal shapes, the
head being better proportioned with the body.</p>

<p>It was enough to split one of the heaps and watch
the termites at work to learn a lesson of what devotion
and duty mean. In the many passages overcrowded
with ants&mdash;there was never confusion&mdash;you saw hun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-157" id="Pg_1-157"></a>[<a href="./images/1-157.png">157</a>]</span>dreds
of them, either conveying food or building
materials to the various quarters. Some carried
leaves, others carried pieces of wood, seeds, or dead
insects. If one was not strong enough to convey its
load, others came to its assistance&mdash;although they
generally seemed to resent the intrusion of others in
doing their work. I always noticed that when one was
in difficulty and others ran to the rescue there generally
ensued what seemed to be a row, and the new arrivals
hurriedly left&mdash;either disgusted or angry, I could not
tell which by their minute expression.</p>

<p>Then there were extraordinarily fat lady ants,
lying flat upon their backs, and with many attendants
around them doing massage and general nursing with
the greatest possible gentleness and care. If one wanted
to see a great commotion one only had to introduce
into one of the chambers a larger ant of a different
kind. What struck me was that the moment the fray
was over the termites at once&mdash;if perhaps a little more
excitedly&mdash;resumed their work.</p>

<p>What astonished me more than anything was that
they would go on working at all&mdash;as if nothing had
happened&mdash;when I split open one of their dwellings
and many of the channels, which must have been
normally in the dark&mdash;were now exposed to the light.
This made me suspect that their vision was either
missing altogether or was very defective.</p>

<p>Nature is a wonderful organizer. The majority of
termites&mdash;including warriors and workers&mdash;were sexless;
that was perhaps why they were such good workers,
as they had nothing to distract them. The males and
females whose duty was merely to propagate and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-158" id="Pg_1-158"></a>[<a href="./images/1-158.png">158</a>]</span>
improve the race were provided temporarily with wings,
so that they could fly away from the colony and disseminate
their love among other winged termites of
other colonies. The relation between different colonies
was friendly. When their task was accomplished and
flight was no more necessary for them, they conveniently
and voluntarily shed their wings, leaving merely a small
section of the wing root attached to the thorax.</p>

<p>The local name for all kinds of termites was <i>cupim</i>,
but technically they are known in the Order of <i>Neoroptera</i>
as <i>Termes album</i>. Another variety of insect, the
<i>Psocus domesticus</i>, was also as destructive as the <i>Termes
album</i>.</p>

<p>We frequently met with plants of <i>caju</i>, or <i>acaju</i> or
<i>acajueiro</i> (<i>Anacardium Occidentale</i> L.) on our course.
They belonged to the <i>Terebinthace&aelig;</i> group. In a preceding
chapter I have already described the red or
yellow delicious fruit of this tree. Then we found other
interesting trees, such as the <i>oleo</i>, the tall and handsome
<i>poinna</i>, and numerous specimens of the small but
good-looking palm <i>pindova</i>.</p>

<p>There were not many flowers in that particular spot,
barring perhaps an occasional cluster of white flowers,
principally <i>bocca de carneiro</i>, said to have properties
refreshing for the blood.</p>

<p>Near a small stream I noticed some lovely, slender,
tall <i>jeguitiba vermelho</i> trees (<i>Couratari estrellensis</i> Raddi),
from 75 to 80 ft. high, with branches and clusters of
deep green healthy leaves at the summit only.</p>

<p>There was a little less monotony in the scenery
before us that day, for to the west stood, over a long,
slightly undulating line, one peculiar conical hill heavily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-159" id="Pg_1-159"></a>[<a href="./images/1-159.png">159</a>]</span>
wooded. In pools of stagnant water were lovely water
flowers, and in the neighbourhood of that moisture
many handsome <i>burity</i> palms were prominent in the
landscape.</p>

<p>We had been mounting gently all the time from our
last camp. Early in the afternoon we reached that
magnificent river, the Araguaya, over 200 yards wide,
although something like between 2,500 and 3,000 kil.,
or perhaps more, from its mouth. Its lovely placid
waters, reflecting with the faithfulness of a mirror the
vegetation on the high steep banks as well as the clouds
in the sky, made an effective picture. The dead silence,
disturbed only by the shouts of my men urging the
mules to the water-side, was most impressive, the water
flowing so slowly that it almost looked stagnant.</p>

<p>Not a mountain, not a hill could be perceived,
except one low humble range of hills to the south. It
was on those hills that the great Araguaya had its
birth.</p>

<p>We crossed the great stream&mdash;mules, baggage and
all, on three canoes upon which a platform had been
erected. Once landed on its western bank, we were,
notwithstanding local boundary quarrels, in the immense
State of Matto Grosso, the wildest of Brazil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I seemed</span> to have no luck on that journey. Everything
went wrong all the time. Everything seemed to stand
in my way to prevent my progress. My men were
demoralized, my mules and horses in a pitiable condition.
I called a halt of two or three days in order
that we might shoe the animals again and rearrange the
pack-saddles. We had, of course, a good supply of new
shoes, but the work of shoeing so many animals was hard,
especially as I had to do most of it myself with Alcides
and Filippe, the other men being absolutely useless.
Add to this a stifling temperature of 90&deg; Fahrenheit.</p>

<p class="fsc">Caraja Indian of the Upper Araguaya River.</p>
<hr />
<p>To make things worse there came a downpour, such
as I have seldom seen, and which lasted for two entire
days. That was the dry season too! The house in
which we had put up&mdash;and through the roof of which
we could admire the stars at our ease while in bed&mdash;was
turned into a regular swimming-tank when the
rain came. We had a good deal of trouble to keep our
things dry, propping them up on improvised stands of
stones which we removed from the crumbling walls of
the building. Fortunately, most of my pack-saddle
cases were air- and water-tight, so that the contents
could not be injured. The wind blew with great fury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-161" id="Pg_1-161"></a>[<a href="./images/1-161.png">161</a>]</span>&mdash;at
the rate of 460 metres a minute, to be strictly
accurate.</p>

<p>There was a humble hamlet at Rio Grande or Porto
do Castanho, on the Matto Grosso side, where we had
crossed the Araguaya River. It was the gloomiest
of gloomy places even in glorious weather. Imagine
it on a wet, windy day. The few tiny one-storied
cabins&mdash;they could hardly be called houses&mdash;had got
soaked with the storm, and looked miserable. The
inhabitants were busy baling water from inside their
dwellings. Many tiles of the roofs had been blown
away, and those that remained had grown extra dark
with the moisture, with merely a bluish tinge from the
reflected light of the grey sky upon their shiny surfaces.
The solitary palm tree at the end of the oblong square
looked pitiful, with its long bladed leaves split and
broken by the wind, while the dense foliage along the
river banks was now several tones darker and richer
than we had seen it before.</p>

<p>Under usual circumstances the <i>plaza</i>&mdash;or square&mdash;was
so high above the river that one could not see the
water at all until one went to the edge of the stream,
but during flood the river rose as much as 20 ft. and
occasionally overflowed the greater portion of the
square.</p>

<p>The grass of the square&mdash;a mere field&mdash;alone seemed
happy in the damp. Half dried and an&aelig;mic from the
hot sun, it seemed to be quickly coming back to life
and vigour in those few hours which had rendered us
all miserable. My poor horses and mules, worn and
sore, stood dripping and wretched, with quivering knees,
in the middle of the square&mdash;too miserable to feed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-162" id="Pg_1-162"></a>[<a href="./images/1-162.png">162</a>]</span>
only now and then slashing their long wet tails to right
or left to drive away impertinent flies.</p>

<p>With the storm the temperature had suddenly
descended to 75&deg;, and everybody was shivering with
cold after the oppressive heat before the storm.</p>

<p>Upon the half-rotted wooden cross which stood
in front of the church was perched a vulture&mdash;so thin
and shaggy and soaked and motionless that you might
easily have mistaken it for a stuffed bird. It was the
very picture of misery. But everybody was miserable&mdash;one
could not help it. I was, too&mdash;who am not
much given to being depressed.</p>

<p>While marching or camping in the midst of unspoilt
nature, I never felt depressed, no matter what happened,
and was absolutely regardless of climatic conditions;
but in those miserable settlements&mdash;feeble attempts at
civilization&mdash;I must confess that I used to get low-spirited
too, and often thought what an idiot I had been
to leave my happy homes in Florence and in London,
in order to come to these wretched places.</p>

<p>After the attempts at baling out the water had
proved futile&mdash;as there was more coming in than it
was possible to fling out&mdash;the people in resignation
barricaded their doors and windows. Not a soul
was to be seen or heard anywhere. The place was
absolutely dead. Even after the storm was over no
sign of life could be noticed. The people were all
still hiding and trembling in their houses, the comparatively
slight but sudden change in the temperature
bringing upon most of them attacks of strong malarial
fever, which was there prevalent.</p>

<p>At last, splashing her little naked feet along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-163" id="Pg_1-163"></a>[<a href="./images/1-163.png">163</a>]</span>
footpath in the grass&mdash;now changed into a streamlet&mdash;there
approached a little girl with a face as black as
coal. She looked terrified as she approached the window
out of which I was looking. But she overcame her
fright and, prettily stretching out her tiny hand, called
out "<i>Boa tarde!</i>" (Good afternoon). Her father and
mother were ill; would I give her some medicine for
them? Soon after, when the sky had cleared, other
patients came along asking for quinine or any medicine
I could give them. Others wished to have their teeth
pulled out. The Brazilians of the interior had great
trouble with their teeth, which were usually in a state
of decay.</p>

<p>My own men had wrapped themselves up in their
blankets in order to keep warm. They had slept most
of the time. They were too cold and lazy even to get
up to cook and eat their food. None of the houses
possessed a chimney, cooking being done outside; nor,
of course, any sanitary arrangements. Those of my
men who had toothache cried and moaned the whole
night, as might be expected of children aged six of any
other country. I have seldom seen men more sensitive
and frightened at pain or illness.</p>

<p>The main structure at Porto do Castanho (Port of
the Chestnut Tree, because there should be a chestnut
tree there) was the church, a mere barn, which elsewhere
but in central Brazil would not be considered
good enough for storing hay, still less for the worship
of the Almighty. Not that it was used much for the
latter purpose, as there was no priest within several
hundred kilometres. The walls of the church were all
scraped and dirty, the corners chipped off by passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-164" id="Pg_1-164"></a>[<a href="./images/1-164.png">164</a>]</span>
animals. All the passers-by went and wiped their
dirty hands on the walls of the church&mdash;perhaps attracted
by the whitewash, which none of the other
buildings possessed.</p>

<p>The shops&mdash;there were two&mdash;had nothing for sale,
except some locally grown tobacco. In one shop I
found some small iron nails, which were sold at the
equivalent of 6<i>d.</i> each!</p>

<p>May 11th. The drenching rain continued the entire
night, the minimum temperature being 73&deg; Fahrenheit.
My poor animals were in a terrible condition the next
morning through the damp, the sores having become
badly infected. They were in a purulent condition, and
a mass of maggots&mdash;the terrible <i>bishus</i>, which were the
pest of Brazil. So we had the great job of cleaning them
all with a powerful disinfectant as well as washing them
with a decoction of warm <i>barbatim&atilde;o</i> (<i>Stryphnodendron
barbatim&atilde;o</i> M.), a wood with a great resistance to crushing
(K. 1&middot;015) and a specific gravity of 1&middot;275. The
decoction, which was really very beneficial for wounds
and sores of animals, was made with the bark of that
tree warmed in water over a fire. Another decoction
we frequently used was of salt and <i>carrapicho</i> herb, but
this was not quite so effective as the former.</p>

<p>My men killed a magnificent <i>tucano</i>&mdash;a large bird
with climbing, inquisitive habits. It possessed an
enormous yellow bill of singularly light structure, the
point of which was black. The lower part of the bill
was of a brilliant red, and of a similar red was the rib
of the upper part of the bill. The plumage was of a
handsome velvety black on the body and tail&mdash;quite
shiny&mdash;while the chest was of a pure white, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-165" id="Pg_1-165"></a>[<a href="./images/1-165.png">165</a>]</span>
under part of the tail of bright vermilion feathers.
White feathers showed at the base of the tail above.</p>

<p>The <i>tucano</i> (<i>Ramphastos</i>) is too well known for me
to describe it fully again. It is found all over tropical
Brazil. There are many different varieties, such as
the <i>Ramphastos vitellinus</i>, <i>Ramphastos ariel</i>, the <i>Ramphastos
Cuvieri</i>, the <i>Pteroglossus Beauharnaisii</i>, or curl-crested
tucano, etc., extremely common, especially
farther north, near the borders of the Amazon.</p>

<p>I was sorry when my men killed this beautiful bird.
I had watched it for some time, with its inquisitive
habits, hopping from branch to branch, peeping its
bill into cavities and examining everything that happened
below by bending its head attentively, now on
one side then on the other. It evidently took intelligent
interest in our doings. My men had gone out to
do their cooking. The bird watched them with the
greatest attention&mdash;with jerky movements not unlike
those of a magpie.</p>

<p>The tucanos have, I believe, been described as
being stupid; but on the contrary I think they are
extremely clever&mdash;quite as clever as many parrots or
macaws. I observed how shrewd that particular bird
was. It would come quite close to us, and examine
with really amazing attention what we were doing as
long as we were not taking any notice of it, but the
moment a man happened to touch a stone or try to
point a rifle at it, it would fly a long distance off,
with shrill yelps, and would not return until it was quite
sure that we were not noticing its presence.</p>

<p>The uses of the enormous bill of the tucano have
often been discussed by ornithologists, many of whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-166" id="Pg_1-166"></a>[<a href="./images/1-166.png">166</a>]</span>
believe that the bill is of no use to that bird and Nature
made in this case a mistake and has not yet had time
to rectify it. Scientists frequently allege that Nature
makes mistakes, because many of them have never
really understood Nature. How could they? They
have never been near enough to Nature unspoiled.
Many of them also believe that tucano birds are great
fishers, following the notion that many water birds
have red or yellow bills of large size. That, too, is
another great mistake, for the tucano is eminently a
fruit and nut eater, and of course a feeder on worms and
insects contained in fruit.</p>

<p>The huge bill, attaining the length of six or seven
inches, is toothed at the sides in order to be able to saw
the stems of fruit. The shape and size of the bill,
far from being a mistake of nature, are made so in
order to enable that bird to dig holes into the bark of
trees and to enable it to crush and chew the many
curiously shaped fruits found in certain parts of the
Brazilian forest. Moreover, the bill is also a great
protection to the head in going through the dense
foliage, where thorns are innumerable and alive with
dangerous insects of great size, which can, owing to
the length of its beak, be destroyed at a distance from
the bird's most vital organs.</p>

<p>These birds have received the name <i>tucano</i> from
the noise they make, which resembles "<i>tok-kan</i>" very
sharply pronounced and with a snap at the end of
each syllable.</p>

<p>The tucanos are good climbers, but not good fliers.
In fact, their flight is somewhat clumsy and heavy.
They seldom fly long distances. They spend all their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-167" id="Pg_1-167"></a>[<a href="./images/1-167.png">167</a>]</span>
time on the higher branches of trees. They are
generally to be seen alone or in couples, or perhaps
occasionally in flocks of three or four.</p>

<p>What spare moments I had in Castanho&mdash;after the
storm was over&mdash;I spent on the banks of the river
looking at the magnificent stream.</p>

<p>Looking south, a low hill range could be seen
in the distance with a conical summit rising slightly
above the range&mdash;the Serra do Cayapo. It was there,
as I have said, that the great Araguaya had its birth.
It was interesting to note that the head waters of
the Araguaya&mdash;flowing north, of course&mdash;had their
birth within an infinitesimal distance of those of
two such immense rivers as the Inducassu and the
Sucuru, flowing into the Parana, and also near the
somewhat unknown Taquary River flowing into the
Paraguay.</p>

<p>It would be possible&mdash;although perhaps expensive&mdash;by
means of raised artificial lakes and locks actually to
join at least one of these southern great rivers to the
great Araguaya, and thus&mdash;barring some troublesome
rapids&mdash;form a continuous waterway from south to north
across South America, from Buenos Ayres, roughly in
Lat. 34&deg; 5&#8242; south, to Par&aacute; in Lat. 1&deg; 27&#8242; 6&#8243; South.
Imagine a distance by river extending for 33&deg; 37&#8242; 54&#8243;
(or 3,737 kil.) in a straight line&mdash;as the crow flies&mdash;and
not less than double that distance if we include
the constant turns and deviations in the various connected
rivers.</p>

<p>Easier still and less expensive would be to connect
by rail the last two navigable points of those two
streams. That will certainly be done some day, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-168" id="Pg_1-168"></a>[<a href="./images/1-168.png">168</a>]</span>
those abandoned regions are eventually populated and
properly developed.</p>

<p>There were some rocky falls just below Porto
Castanho which prevented navigation as far as the place
where we crossed the Araguaya&mdash;otherwise the river
was navigable from those falls as far as Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o.</p>

<p>The formation of the clouds over the great Araguaya
River was peculiar. Great clusters of globular clouds
generally collected in three distinct strata upon a
whitish sky as far as high up upon the sky vault.</p>

<p>Facing north, the country appeared absolutely flat,
and nothing could be seen above the trees as far as
the eye or even a telescope could perceive. In that
direction the stream, 200 yards wide, flowed through a
perfectly straight channel for about one mile.</p>

<p>The fishing in the river was excellent. One night
we caught a lot of fish. One, a huge <i>pirarara</i> weighing
40 lb., then some <i>pirahiba</i> and a <i>pintado</i>, the latter
24 lb. in weight. The <i>pirarara</i> was an extraordinary-looking
fish. It had a long head covered entirely with
a hard, bony, granular substance, which could only be
cracked by a severe blow with an axe. The eyes were
prominent and placed quite close to abnormally long
antenn&aelig; or feelers. The back of the <i>pirarara</i> was
bluish black, the centre of the body longitudinally was
yellowish, whereas the under part was white. The
tail was of a bright vermilion, and the black fins had
red edges, which made the huge <i>pirarara</i> a really beautiful
fish to look at.</p>

<p class="fsc">One Night's Fishing on the Araguaya.</p>
<hr />
<p>The <i>pirahiba</i> had a grey back with stripes so faint
that they were hardly visible. Its head was flat and
anchor-shaped. The eyes&mdash;very small&mdash;were curiously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-169" id="Pg_1-169"></a>[<a href="./images/1-169.png">169</a>]</span>
situated on the top of the head instead of at the sides&mdash;owing
to the fact that the head was really so flat that
it had no sides: it was merely a gentle convex curve
from one side of the mouth to the other over the skull.
The <i>pirahiba</i> too, like most fish of those rivers, possessed
long tentacles. Its mouth and fins were slightly tinted
red. It displayed powerful teeth similarly arranged
to those of the <i>pintado</i> fish previously described.</p>

<p>Then we got some <i>tubarao</i> (or <i>Squalus carcharias</i>)&mdash;a
small fish with a long, pointed head like a bird's
beak, of the <i>plagiostomos</i> order, and several <i>mand&#297;</i>&mdash;a small
yellow fish with enormous eyes. The <i>mand&#297;</i>
had remarkable vitality. Seven hours after it had
been caught&mdash;I had no idea the poor thing was still
alive&mdash;it gave several leaps in the air, and when I put
it in a bucket of water it shortly began to swim as if
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>There were only two or three very small dug-outs on
the Araguaya, none of which were capable of carrying
more than one or two people. There was no boat there
large enough to carry all my men and baggage, had I
even at that moment decided to descend that river
instead of proceeding west. I took observations for
latitude and longitude at Porto Castanho, as well as
boiling-point observations with the hypso-metrical apparatus,
the latter in order to get the exact elevation,
and also to keep a check on my several aneroids which I
used on the journey merely for differential observations.</p>

<p>May 9th, 1910. Boiling point, 210&deg; 3 F. Temperature
of the air, 83&deg; F. = 1182 ft. above the sea level.
By Aneroid, 1190 ft.</p>

<p>My mules having had a good rest, I was making ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-170" id="Pg_1-170"></a>[<a href="./images/1-170.png">170</a>]</span>
to start on May 12th, when one of my men refused
to come any farther. He wished to be paid off and
go. So he received his pay and went. He would
probably end his existence in that filthy little hamlet.
He would never have the energy to return to
Goyaz alone. I was rather glad he had gone, as,
a few nights previously, he had fired at me while
I was asleep. The bullet had actually made a hole
through the canvas of my camp bed. I had fortunately
taken the precaution to alter the position of
my bed&mdash;under my tent&mdash;a precaution I took every
night, after my men had gone to sleep in their hammocks,
some distance outside. The man had evidently
aimed where he thought my head was resting. I having
turned the bed around, the bullet, fired from the man
standing, went just over my ankles, perforating the
canvas quite close to them. I naturally came out of
my tent to see what was the matter, and saw the man
with the rifle in his hand.</p>

<p>"Why did you shoot?" I inquired, as the man,
evidently surprised to see me standing before him,
ejaculated disconnected words.</p>

<p>"I saw a huge <i>on&ccedil;a</i>" (a jaguar) ... "it was
there ... I saw its two eyes shining like fire...."</p>

<p>"Did you kill the <i>on&ccedil;a</i>?"</p>

<p>"No, it leapt away."</p>

<p>I advised the man, patting him paternally on
the back, not to startle everybody again. If he
should see another <i>on&ccedil;a</i> he had better come to me.
I seldom missed when I fired at all&mdash;as I had been
able to show them a few days before. I did not wish
my men to behave like so many timid young girls,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-171" id="Pg_1-171"></a>[<a href="./images/1-171.png">171</a>]</span>
as I wished to be able to tell people in Europe that
Brazilians were brave and noble.</p>

<p>"Firing in such a fashion indiscriminately," I explained
to him, "you might have even killed one of
your companions! Now go to sleep like a good fellow,
and do not fire again!"</p>

<p>I spoke to the rascal in the gentlest of ways, never
for one moment letting him suspect that I knew he
had intended that bullet to go through my head. Nor
did I ever take any of the other men into my confidence.
When they asked what the commotion was about, I
told them that their companion had fired at a jaguar
and the jaguar had leapt away. There is only one
effective weapon you can use with scoundrels. It is
the greatest calm and kindness.</p>

<p>The man, hiding his face in his hands, threw himself
upon his hammock and began to sob. He sobbed and
sobbed and sobbed until the morning&mdash;much to the inconvenience
of everybody in camp. At sunrise he had
been seized with a severe attack of rheumatism which
had contracted a leg badly. It was pitiful to see him
walking&mdash;but when he was not aware of being looked
at he walked as well as anybody else.</p>

<p>From that day that fellow never dared look me
straight in the face. He avoided riding near me on
the march, and in camp was sulky and unpleasant,
retiring to a distance and declining to work. He was
relieved of the functions of cook. The last time he had
produced a meal nearly brought massacre upon him at
the hands of the other men.</p>

<p>He received his full pay up to date, without uttering
a word of thanks. He duly signed a receipt with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-172" id="Pg_1-172"></a>[<a href="./images/1-172.png">172</a>]</span>
thumb-mark, as he was unable to write. When the
troop of horses and mules and his companions left, he
never spoke a word of farewell to his companions or
animals, nor to me. He sat silent and motionless, with
his eyes riveted to the ground as if in a trance. Some
days later we discovered that he had stolen from our
store some 40 lbs. of coffee and a large quantity of sugar,
as well as a number of other articles which had been
useful to us.</p>

<p>The sky when we left was overcast, and huge
globular clouds, white and grey, hung in great masses,
especially half way up the vault of the sky. The
country, after crossing the Araguaya, was remarkably
beautiful, from an agricultural point of view&mdash;enormous
campos or prairies&mdash;over rich alluvial deposits, with
scanty stunted trees upon them. Plenty of <i>burity</i> palms
grew in the lower depressions.</p>

<p>My men suffered intensely from the cold at night&mdash;the
minimum being 60&deg; Fahr., maximum 92&deg;, in the
afternoon of the 13th. The temperature had been
much lower since we had crossed the great river. The
elevation was only 1,250 ft.</p>

<p>Rising slowly over an undulation in the country
to 1,300 ft., we began to find igneous rock showing
through the surface soil, especially on the higher points.</p>

<p><i>Lixia</i> (<i>Nephelium Litchi</i> Carab), <i>caraiba</i> and the
<i>laranjeira do campo</i> (<i>Citrus vulgaris</i>), were trees to be
seen in that region.</p>

<p>We had wonderfully clear sky in the morning. At
noon it became slightly clouded, while in the afternoon
one-third of the sky was covered. A light breeze blew
from the west.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-173" id="Pg_1-173"></a>[<a href="./images/1-173.png">173</a>]</span>
Some 28 kil. from the Araguaya we came to a small
miserable farmhouse. After a great deal of bargaining
I was able to purchase some extra horses. The people
had no idea whatever of the value of money, and
named sums at first which would have easily purchased
the finest horses on the English turf. They descended
in time to more reasonable figures.</p>

<p>Our life was rendered miserable all day by the
millions of <i>pium</i> or gnats that swarmed around us and
stung us with incredible fierceness and viciousness.
Those little brutes left on our skins black marks fully
as large as themselves wherever they stung us. The
itching was most trying. Those marks remained for
several weeks, and only disappeared when we perforated
them with a needle to let the blood out, or waited long
enough for them to become desiccated and the skin
re-formed.</p>

<p><i>Pium</i> is a word of the Tupi and Tupinamba Indians'
language. Those tiny insects entered your eyes,
leaving behind an odoriferous acid which caused great
irritation of the lids. We removed dozens every
day from our eyes. Fortunately they were easily
extracted. They also dashed into your ears, up your
nose, and, whenever you opened it, inside your mouth.</p>

<p>It was well worth going to Matto Grosso to enjoy
the lovely moonlight nights, only comparable in their
luminous splendour to nights of Central Africa in the
middle of the Sahara desert, and to those on the high
Tibetan plateau in Asia. The light of the moon was
so vivid that one could see almost as well as in the
daytime.</p>

<p>Personally, the crisp cool air (min. 59&deg; Fahr.) made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-174" id="Pg_1-174"></a>[<a href="./images/1-174.png">174</a>]</span>
me feel in most excellent health and spirits, but my
men, who had putrid constitutions, were a mass of
aches and pains. Some cried like children the entire
night with toothache, moaning and shrieking like
lunatics when the pain became acute; others got
internal aches, another had cramp in the legs. I must
say that Alcides, with all his faults, was the only one
who always did his work&mdash;not always with common
sense, but he did it&mdash;and, when ill, never gave exhibitions
of pitiful weakness like the others.</p>

<p>Filippe, the negro, who eventually showed himself
to be the bravest Brazilian on that expedition, also
stood the pain more calmly and with manliness. As
I had judged from the first moment I had laid eyes upon
them, those were really the only two men who were any
good at all. "<i>Il bon d&igrave; si vede dal mattino</i>" (A fine
day is seen in the morning), says an ancient and very
true Italian proverb; truer, perhaps, in its philosophy
with individuals than with the weather.</p>

<p>Many of my men's complaints vanished with the
warmth of the sun&mdash;108&deg; Fahr. at 1 p.m., with a
maximum temperature during the day of 85&deg; in the
shade.</p>

<p>With the beautiful clear sky and a gentle breeze
blowing, it was a real delight to march. Only a slight
whitish mist&mdash;always in horizontal streaks&mdash;was to be
noticed near the earth. The sky, although limpid, was
never of a deep blue, but merely of a pale cobalt. The
dew was heavy during the night and soaked everything,
making the baggage, the tents particularly, heavy for
the animals to carry. We still kept at an elevation
of 1,250 ft., noticing, as we marched on, an isolated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-175" id="Pg_1-175"></a>[<a href="./images/1-175.png">175</a>]</span>
range of hills extending from north-east to south-west
and showing considerable erosion at its south-westerly
terminus. Two conical hills&mdash;one a broken cone&mdash;stood
on the summit of a flat plateau, the entire range,
as well as the summit of hills, showing eroded slopes
with vertical wall-like superior portions.</p>

<p>After leaving the stream at the foot of a range
1,450 ft. above the sea level, on rising over a low pass
I could observe to the north-east of that range great
blocks of eruptive rock much perforated, in which were
embedded pellets of yellow lava and of red and black
baked igneous rock. On examining the north-eastern
end of the main part of the range it was apparent that
what remained standing before us was merely one half
of a circular crater, the other half of which had collapsed
or had been blown up by volcanic action. The bottom
of the crater was subsequently filled with alluvial
deposits. There was there a grassy plain with a few
<i>burity</i> palms. In the valley before us was ideal pasture
land, which will some day be of great value.</p>

<p>We crossed two cols (elev. 1,550 ft.) with a beautiful
plain between. Then we descended into a third lovely
valley on the north side of the outer wall of the crater.
The grazing was perfect for the animals. Clusters of
vigorous, healthy <i>burity</i> palms stood in great numbers
in the centre and at the sides of the valley. This
great valley was bounded by two ridges extending in
a northerly direction&mdash;two spurs, as it were. The
rounded, channelled outer sides of the crater to the
north would tend to strengthen the theory that those
slopes were formerly a gradual continuation of the
present inclined valley. On those slopes of the moun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-176" id="Pg_1-176"></a>[<a href="./images/1-176.png">176</a>]</span>tain
hardly any vegetation could be noticed, perhaps
owing to the fact that hard volcanic rock existed under
the thin surface padding of yellowish earth.</p>

<p>The valley was buried in red and grey lapilli and
ashes, finely broken up marble cubes, and fragments
of other forms of crystallized rock.</p>

<p>As we proceeded from camp Fogasso, the northern
slopes of the crater became divided into huge furrows,
the vertical upper part of the crater displaying vividly
rich red tones. The crater was castellated at the summit,
like the walls of a fortress.</p>

<p>The geological formation of that portion of the
Matto Grosso plateau interested me greatly. Each
individual spur, taken separately, showed slopes sometimes
abrupt, sometimes well rounded, separated from
the next spur of hills by a <b>V</b>-shaped or angular, or
else a concave hollow. At the bottom of those hollows
one did not find the slopes continuing the line of the
crater, but the valley was there absolutely flat and
cut the line of the slope sharply. It would almost
appear as if a subsidence of the soil had taken place
in that particular locality, or else one might speculate
whether those abrupt hills had not been the walls of
what was once a subterranean volcanic cauldron&mdash;the
flat valley, in which we were, having been the
bottom of that cauldron. What little rock one found
in the river bed in this valley showed signs of having
been exposed to intense and prolonged heat, and so
did the brilliant red summit of the hill range, which
was also of the deep red typical of hard-baked rock.</p>

<p>The scene which I had before me there in Matto
Grosso greatly reminded me of a similar basin I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-177" id="Pg_1-177"></a>[<a href="./images/1-177.png">177</a>]</span>
seen when the great Bandaisan mountain in Japan was
blown up by a volcanic explosion and left merely the
bottom part of its gigantic internal cauldron with
vertical red walls around it. With the exception of
scanty and an&aelig;mic grass and a few stunted trees, there
was hardly any vegetation noticeable. The Fogasso
stream, on the bank of which we camped, flowed in an
easterly direction into the Araguaya.</p>

<p>The temperature on the plateau was ideal&mdash;min.
63&deg; Fahr. during the night; max. 75&deg;. We were at
an elevation of 1,450 ft.</p>

<p>On May 15th we were travelling along a valley
over which must have once risen the continuation of
a range which stood to the north of us. There were
deep grooves and corrugations in the valley in a
direction from south to north between the two sections
of the now interrupted range. There we found soil of
red, brown and yellow tints, or else great stretches of
grey volcanic ashes and earth mixed, as well as sharply
angular fragments of igneous rock, which showed that
they had not travelled there by rolling on the ground
or propelled by water.</p>

<p>After this we passed close to another curious spur
of mountains on the east&mdash;quite isolated and of a red
vertical columnar formation. Its summit was broken
up&mdash;much more so than that of the plateau-like range
to the south of us which we were following in a parallel
line. The highest point of that range, to the south, was
wooded, and so were the two conical-topped hills which
towered over it. The strata where exposed showed a
slight dip to the north. We crossed the range by two
low cols at elevations of 1,550 ft. and 1,560 ft. respec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-178" id="Pg_1-178"></a>[<a href="./images/1-178.png">178</a>]</span>tively.
On the summit and even lower upon the sides
of those cols we found huge boulders of eruptive rock,
highly ferruginous. Globular lumps, big and small,
of spattered smooth-surfaced yellow lava were to be
found in myriads; also many spherical pellets of
ferruginous, highly-baked rock with innumerable holes
produced while in a state of ebullition. Some of the
ferruginous rocks had pellets of yellow lava firmly
imbedded in them, which had evidently penetrated
while liquid into the hollows of the ferruginous rock
which was already in a semi-solid, or perhaps solidified,
condition. At any rate, when it happened the ferruginous
rock was already harder than the lava.</p>

<p>While I was studying attentively the geological
conditions of that region, the sky suddenly became as
black as ink to the south, and a heavy shower, which
lasted half an hour, drenched us all to the marrow of
our bones. Then it cleared up, and the sun, supplemented
by our natural heat, dried our clothes upon
us again as we went on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stars were of extraordinary brilliancy at night;
so much so that one could see quite well enough by
their light to get about. The atmosphere being
extremely clear, they appeared of immense size, the
planets shining with dazzling, changing colours which
would have filled even the most profane with reverence
for their splendour.</p>

<p>I drew the attention of my men to the wonderful
sight.</p>

<p>"They are stars!" they replied contemptuously;
"Have you never seen stars before?"</p>

<p>It was indeed difficult to enter into conversation
on any subject with them without having an ardent
desire to strangle the lot, they were so ignorantly
offensive. I was thankful I had the sense always to
go about unarmed, or I am certain some of them would
have paid somewhat dearly for their impertinence. I
was glad, too, that I never felt the weight of loneliness,
as days and days would go by without my saying a
word to them, barring perhaps a shout in camp to
bring my breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>

<p>What was even worse than entering into conversation
with them was to listen&mdash;one could not help it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-180" id="Pg_1-180"></a>[<a href="./images/1-180.png">180</a>]</span>
they shouted so loudly all the time&mdash;to the conversation
among themselves. We will not refer to the
choice language they used, so inexplicably sacrilegious
and indecorous that it would have set on edge the
teeth of the coarsest specimens of humanity; but the
subject&mdash;I say subject in the singular, mark you, for
alas! there was only one subject&mdash;discussed in all its
phases perhaps, but only one single subject&mdash;assassination.
The accounts of different murders, in some
of which the men boasted they had taken part,
were nightly repeated in their minutest details to the
assembled crowd&mdash;myself excluded&mdash;sitting around the
fire, while the <i>feij&atilde;o</i>&mdash;beans, so loved by them&mdash;were
being stewed for hours and hours in a cauldron.</p>

<p>There was the story of one murder of which one of
the men was particularly proud, in which he reproduced
the facial expression as well as the smothered
shrieks of the horrified victim. He gave a vivid
description of how the blood squirted out like a fountain
from the jugular vein of the throat as it was being
severed. That story&mdash;most graphically narrated, I
admit&mdash;had taken the fancy of that cruel crowd. Almost
every evening, during the entire time those men were
with me, many long months, I heard that story repeated
amid roars of laughter from the company. Murder&mdash;when
applied to others&mdash;was evidently for them a
great joke!</p>

<p>Inconsiderate to a degree, they would get up and
sing at the top of their voices in the middle of the night
and keep everybody awake while the <i>feij&atilde;o</i> was stewing.
It took hours and hours before those awful black beans
had boiled sufficiently to be edible, and the man who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-181" id="Pg_1-181"></a>[<a href="./images/1-181.png">181</a>]</span>
acted as cook had to sit up the whole night to stir them
up and watch them. Yes, the position of cook for the
camp was not an enviable one, for it meant marching
all day and sitting up all night to prepare the <i>feij&atilde;o</i>
for the following day. Yet the love they had for their
<i>feij&atilde;o</i>&mdash;I never ate the beastly stuff myself&mdash;was so
great that those lazy devils, who could not be induced
on any account to do other work, did not mind at all
having sleepless nights to watch over the stewing
cauldron. With the <i>feij&atilde;o</i> were placed in the pot large
pieces of <i>toucinho</i> (lard). We carried quantities of
<i>feij&atilde;o</i>, for without <i>feij&atilde;o</i> you cannot induce a
Brazilian to do anything or go anywhere. Of the two he would
rather sacrifice his life than lose his daily <i>feij&atilde;o</i>.</p>

<p>It requires great ability, I believe, to cook <i>feij&atilde;o</i>
properly. I noticed that all my men in a body were
ever superintending its preparation. When the cook
in the early hours of the morning happened to let the
fire go down, or in his drowsiness was not stirring it
properly, there were angry shouts from the other
men, who, every time they opened one eye in their
sleep, invariably gazed towards the beloved cooking-pot.</p>

<p>We came to a second range parallel with the one
described before and extending from north-east to
south-west. Again a vertical natural wall was noticeable
to the east. This range was subdivided into
many sections, almost all of the same size and shape.
The end section to the north-east&mdash;which made an
exception&mdash;was about three and a half times the length
of any of the others. I observed some deep vertical
vents such as are frequently to be seen in the sections<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-182" id="Pg_1-182"></a>[<a href="./images/1-182.png">182</a>]</span>
of volcanoes that have partly been blown up. These
vents were particularly numerous in the north-easterly
block, where broad corrugations and some narrow ones&mdash;ten
in all&mdash;were also to be seen.</p>

<p>Two alternatives could explain the present configuration
of that region. There had been either a
great volcanic explosion or else a sudden subsidence.
Personally I was inclined to favour the first hypothesis.
I shall explain why. First because the great fissures
between the various huge blocks and the grooves carved
in those rocks would then at once explain themselves&mdash;caused
naturally by the violent shock. They had
apparently been enlarged in the course of time by
erosion of water and wind, and possibly by the friction
of the d&eacute;bris of the masses of rock settling down when
the stratum was severed. The quantity of d&eacute;bris
of shattered rock minutely broken into cubes and
other angular forms would suggest that some great
shock had occurred. Then the usual yellow pellets
of polished lava, either globular or pear-shaped, or
like an elongated oval ending in a point and well
rounded at the other end, would also indicate that these
missiles had been flying great distances through the
air in a molten state before they had actually dropped.
In fact, the flight was so long as absolutely to cool and
solidify them before they fell&mdash;unless they had fallen
in cold water&mdash;for they had retained their original
form, instead of getting flattened at the heavier end,
as could be expected had the lava reached the ground
in a half-soft state. Large blocks of lava&mdash;which
naturally took a longer time to cool and a shorter time
to reach the earth after their flight through the atmos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-183" id="Pg_1-183"></a>[<a href="./images/1-183.png">183</a>]</span>phere&mdash;had,
in fact, become flattened on the lower side
where they struck the ground. Others of a composite
globular form had invariably been flattened into a
slight curve on the side where they had come in contact
with the soil.</p>

<p>Ovoid rocks as large as a loaf of bread and
composed of compressed cinders were to be seen
about, which, when easily split open, showed a band
of slightly ferruginous matter, very brittle, in a
crystallized condition. In the centre of these rocks
were invariably found beautiful crystals of great
limpidity, easily separated from one another by a
slight pressure of the fingers.</p>

<p>Erosion had evidently since played great part in
the present appearance of the country, but to my
mind&mdash;directly above what is now a valley&mdash;there
existed at one time a high range of mountains, which
was in those days the great dividing line of the waters
flowing south and north.</p>

<p>One might, of course, also argue that what are the
mountains now have been pushed up from underneath
above the ground into their present position, but local
conditions do not tend to encourage this theory.</p>

<p>The strata of red baked rock in the existing mountain
side were almost absolutely horizontal, with merely
a slight dip to the north. In the northern end of the
range the rock showing through the vegetation was
white, as if it had been subjected to baking. The
western aspect of the first range showed also a vertical
summit of red rock with a sloping spur extending
to the west.</p>

<p>We camped that night on the river Prata, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-184" id="Pg_1-184"></a>[<a href="./images/1-184.png">184</a>]</span>
flowed south. Elevation, 1,300 ft. Maximum temperature
85&deg; F., minimum 63&frac12;&deg; F.</p>

<p>The formation of the clouds was always interesting.
The long horizontal streaks across the sky, which were
daily noticeable, took a form that day not unlike the
vertebr&aelig; of an immense snake, whereas the higher
clouds of transparent mist in filaments looked exactly
like a huge spider's web.</p>

<p>We established our camp under a tall, handsome,
slender <i>Xinghi</i>-tree, the triangular fruit of which, with
a light brown, hard skin, was deadly poisonous if eaten.
Alcides told me that in Minas Geraes it was much used
in the manufacture of soap. This tree was extremely
neat-looking, with its clean sinuous branches and its
pretty, light green, healthy leaves, of an elongated oval
shape.</p>

<hr />
<p>My men had insisted on bringing dogs away with
us for safety in case of attack by Indians. They had
in fact procured three&mdash;I would not care to say how&mdash;before
our departure from the Goyaz Province.
Those dogs were just as faithless and lazy and worthless
as the people. They followed us because they
got plenty of food, otherwise they had no affection for
anybody; and, far from giving an alarm when any
person or any animal approached the camp, they were
quite unmoved by anything that happened around
them during the day or night, except at meal-times.
A handsome <i>on&ccedil;a</i> (jaguar) leapt close to camp, and on
perceiving us bounded gracefully away&mdash;the dogs remaining
fast asleep with their noses resting on their
respective extended fore-paws. Another day during
the march a <i>veado</i> (<i>Cervus elaphus</i>), a deer, sprang in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-185" id="Pg_1-185"></a>[<a href="./images/1-185.png">185</a>]</span>
flight clean over one of the dogs without the dog even
noticing him! Game was plentiful in that part of
the country, and the animals were so unaccustomed
to see people, that one could get quite near them.</p>

<p>My men went after game in the morning and we did
not make an early start, in fact not until 10.30 a.m.
It was amazing to see the amount of good water that
was to be found on the plateau. We crossed a streamlet
flowing south (elev. 1,300 ft.), and shortly afterwards,
upon gently inclined land, we crossed another stream,
also flowing south.</p>

<p>We were travelling due west along the foot of a
curious range which stood to our north and of another
of similar characteristics to the south. It seemed
quite possible, in fact, even probable, that the two
ranges were formerly only one, which had then split,
and that we were travelling inside the partially-filled-up
fissure between the two divided ranges. The sky-line
of the two ranges matched exactly on both sides&mdash;first
a long hump, then two smaller humps, after
that a more even and continuous line.</p>

<p>On reaching an elevation of 1,500 ft. we were confronted
with a splendid view of a flat plateau to the
west. By a steep descent we went down 300 ft. to
a river (elev. 1,200 ft. above the sea level) in a hollow,
reached by going through dense tall grass and thick
vegetation. A humble wooden cross by the stream
marked the spot where a Brazilian had been murdered
by Indians.</p>

<p>Interesting flows and domes of lava were to be seen
near the stream, after which our marching that day
was mostly up and down campos with magnificent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-186" id="Pg_1-186"></a>[<a href="./images/1-186.png">186</a>]</span>
grazing, the general slope of which was from north to
south. At an elevation of 1,400 ft., on turning our
heads back, we had a general view of the two ranges
which had become separated.</p>

<p>On one side of the range, a sloping back was noticeable,
whereas on the opposite side were almost vertical
sides, much grooved, with a terrace about two-thirds
up the total elevation, except at the western end, where
the terrace was instead exactly half way up, with a
minor terrace near the summit.</p>

<p>We met and crossed another streamlet, and then
rose on our route to 1,550 ft., from where another
beautiful view of the plateau to the south-west could
be obtained, a low hill range with a higher peak in
front of it, and the immense green campos at a slanting
angle. Another fine panoramic view of the two divided
ranges was also before us, although from that particular
point of vantage it was slightly more difficult to
reconstruct their former appearance in one's imagination
than from the centre of the valley we had crossed,
although even from that point the fact was apparent
with a little study.</p>

<p>On proceeding down to the river we met some flows
of red lava and, upon the top of nearly every undulation,
boulders of black eruptive rock showed through, highly
ferruginous, as well as much lava in pellets. D&eacute;bris of
baked red and black rock were to be found in quantities
down the slopes and at the bottom of those undulations,
carried there evidently by water. In one or two places,
such as near the river at Ponte Keimada, I smashed
some of the larger boulders of yellow lava. Here is
what I found inside: Under an outer coating of lava<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-187" id="Pg_1-187"></a>[<a href="./images/1-187.png">187</a>]</span>
an inch thick there was a layer of solidified cinders.
Under that lay a thin layer of lava, then again yet another
layer of grey ashes, then lava again. This would
indicate that those boulders had gradually reached
their present shape partly in revolutions through
the air thick with cinders, partly by rolling down or
along intermittent stretches of molten lava and cinders
during a great eruption, or perhaps during several
successive eruptions. Personally, I think that it was
during various periods of one eruption before the lava
had cooled, so that in its sticky state it would easily
collect the ashes round it, which it would certainly not
do in its polished, solidified state.</p>

<p>When we had passed beyond the western end of the
two parallel ranges a great change was noticeable in
the appearance of the country we were crossing. We
missed the long, sweeping, uninterrupted lines of the
scenery, and had before our eyes a confused surface
of bosses, mounds and short undulations, with thick
luxuriant vegetation upon them which prevented my
studying carefully their geological formation. The
soil, of a rich red colour, showed every indication of
being extremely fertile in that particular climate.</p>

<p>From the point where we stood, one could well
judge the effects of the great volcanic explosion on the
back of the range&mdash;the one to our left&mdash;where a long
line of buttresses had formed, as if on that side a
subsidence on a large scale had also taken place. It was
in any case curious to notice that at the two termini
east and west of the two parallel ranges white rock
in columnar form was exposed in both ranges in corresponding
sites.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-188" id="Pg_1-188"></a>[<a href="./images/1-188.png">188</a>]</span>
The slope noticeable on the north side of the
southern range could be explained by the tilting of the
strata where the separation took place. The angle of
the strata clearly demonstrated this fact.</p>

<p>Millions of mosquitoes and <i>piums</i>, <i>carrapatinhos</i> and
<i>carrapatos</i> made life unbearable both during the day
and night. We never had a moment's respite. The
gnats, too, in thick swarms around us were a constant
worry&mdash;we were all day busy removing them from our
eyes and ears. They stung us all over most mercilessly.
I was making a botanical collection, which not
only contained specimens of the leaves of all the trees
we met with, but also of minor plants and various kinds
of grass. This involved getting off my mule many
times a day. Whenever I put my feet on the ground
or touched a blade of grass I well knew what was in
store for me. At once I became literally covered with
<i>carrapatinhos</i>, and set to scratch myself so violently that
nothing short of digging my nails into my skin seemed
to relieve the irritation&mdash;and that, mind you, only
momentarily. One had to bear it, and wait until
one got to camp in the evening before one could disinfect
oneself all over. In this world one never gets
credit for anything, but I do think that few men under
those circumstances would have gone on, as I did,
collecting botanical specimens for no reward whatever
except my own pleasure, if pleasure it can be called.</p>

<p>Again we noticed that day wonderful effects of
clouds in filaments, one group stretching along the
sky in an arc from north to east like the dorsal bone
and ribs of an immense fish.</p>

<p>We camped on the bank of a stream (elev. 1,050 ft.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-189" id="Pg_1-189"></a>[<a href="./images/1-189.png">189</a>]</span>
flowing north-east, which was, I think, the same stream
we had met in the morning, and which had described
a big turn.</p>

<p>My men amused me with their fears. Even when
in camp they never left their rifles for a moment.
When they went only a few yards away, either to fetch
water or bring back a mule, they invariably took all
their weapons with them&mdash;carbines, automatic pistols,
and daggers.</p>

<p>In order to collect specimens and examine the
country, I sometimes strayed away alone for long
distances from camp&mdash;sometimes for two or three hours
at a time&mdash;always absolutely unarmed. My men
began to be thoroughly frightened of the immunity
I possessed from attacks of wild beasts and Indians.
Although I told them that wild beasts never attacked
human beings unless attacked first, and that there were
no Indians about, my men would not believe me.
They maintained that I must have some special secret
of my own which brought me back alive, and that I
must be even bullet-proof. They could never be
induced to go alone&mdash;even when armed&mdash;for more than
a few metres from camp.</p>

<p>We were having cool nights. Minimum 59&deg; Fahr.,
maximum 80&deg; Fahr.&mdash;on May 17th. A mackerel sky
of the prettiest design was overhead, like a lovely
mosaic of white and blue porcelain, while a band of
clear blue encircled us all around above the horizon line.</p>

<p>Across a forest we continued our journey, rising
some 300 ft. to 1,350 ft. above the sea level, where we
again found campos and forest alternately upon deep
masses of fine red sand or else great expanses of grey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-190" id="Pg_1-190"></a>[<a href="./images/1-190.png">190</a>]</span>
and black volcanic cinders intermixed in patches. On
reaching the highest elevation we actually went over
6 kil. of volcanic sand and ashes, and in one place
traversed a patch of shattered d&eacute;bris with cutting edges
of eruptive rock, and brilliant red or deep black pebbles.
Then again we saw masses of the usual ferruginous,
much-perforated rocks&mdash;many so absolutely spherical
as to resemble cannon-balls.</p>

<p>To the west we could see before us lovely green undulations&mdash;campos&mdash;with,
in the centre, a curious hump
that looked as though due to subterranean pressure.
In the distance was visible another of those long flat-topped
plateaus typical of Brazil, with a headland
which, owing, it seemed, chiefly to erosion, had become
separated from the main range. It resembled and was
parallel with the second range of the split mountains we
had just left. Some nine kilometres from our last camp
we encountered the river Das Corgo, flowing south
(elev. 1,150 ft.) over a bed formed by an impressive
great flow of solidified red lava covered in some places
by deposits of bright red earth. Beyond the river we
found ourselves again upon yellow sand and ashes.</p>

<p>Beneath a cirro-cumulus&mdash;or mackerel sky&mdash;again
that day, wonderfully beautiful because of its perfection
of design, we were gradually rising over the
domed elevation we had previously observed, upon
which we found masses of tiny pebbles&mdash;what are
known to geologists by the Italian name of "puzzolana"
or <i>scori&aelig;</i> reduced to a granular condition.
Farther on, travelling over other undulations, we sank
into thick deposits of grey and yellow volcanic scori&aelig;,
such as fine sand, cinders, and lapilli. At the highest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-191" id="Pg_1-191"></a>[<a href="./images/1-191.png">191</a>]</span>
point (elev. 1,270 ft.) we travelled over deep sediments
of sand and ashes mixed together. All those undulations,
as a matter of fact, were above great buried
flows of red lava, which were invariably exposed to
sight in the depressions, particularly in the beds of
rivers.</p>

<p>Being a great lover of good water&mdash;to my mind
the elixir of life, the great secret of health and strength&mdash;I
was always enraptured by the deliciousness of the
water in the streams we met. It was so crystalline
and limpid that one could not resist the temptation
of drinking it, even when not thirsty. I always carried
slung to my saddle an enamelled tin cup attached to a
string so as to be able to procure myself a drink at all
the streams without getting off my mount.</p>

<p>Twelve kilometres from our last camp we came to
a watercourse flowing into a big stream at the bottom
of the valley. Its bed was in overlapping terraces of
polished red lava.</p>

<p>The green country before us, in great sweeping
undulations, reminded one much, in its regularity, of
the great waves of the ocean&mdash;what sailors call "long
seas." Where the stream had cut through and left the
underlying dome of lava exposed one could easily judge
of the thick deposits of sand, ashes and pulverized rock
which formed the strata above it.</p>

<p>We travelled over more red volcanic sand for some
four kilometres, rising to 1,400 ft., on which elevation
was thick <i>matto</i>, or stunted, much entangled forest.
Then we emerged once more into glorious open country,
marching over a stratum 8 ft. thick of whitish tufa and
ashes, this stratum lying immediately above one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-192" id="Pg_1-192"></a>[<a href="./images/1-192.png">192</a>]</span>
red volcanic earth. The strata were easily measurable
where rivulets had cut deep grooves in the softer
superficial strata and had reached the foundation layer
of lava.</p>

<p>The campos seemed to get more and more beautiful
as we went west. What magnificent grazing land!
One could imagine on it millions and millions of happy,
fat cattle; but no, not one was to be seen anywhere.
What a pity to see such wonderful country go to waste!
There was everything there, barring, perhaps, easy
transport, to make the happiness and fortune of thousands
upon thousands of farmers&mdash;excellent grazing,
fertile soil, good healthy climate and delicious and
plentiful water&mdash;but the country was absolutely deserted.</p>

<p>For miles the beautiful prairies extended, especially
to the south-west, where in the distant background
loomed a high, flat-topped tableland, interrupted by
two deep cuts in its extensive monotonous sky-line.
Those cuts were near its southern end. To the south
stood a long range of wooded hills&mdash;also with an absolutely
flat sky-line. We ourselves were not higher than
1,400 ft. above the sea level. My animals stumbled
along over a region of much-broken-up d&eacute;bris; then
again travelling was easier, although heavy, over tufa,
sand and ashes. On descending to a stream, 1,200 ft.
above sea level, we slipped terribly on the steep argillaceous
slope, and the animals had great difficulty in
climbing up on the opposite side, where we made our
camp.</p>

<hr />
<p>The streamlet flowed east into a larger stream, which
we also crossed, and which flowed south-west.</p>

<p>It seemed to be getting colder at night as we went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-193" id="Pg_1-193"></a>[<a href="./images/1-193.png">193</a>]</span>
westward (May 18th, min. 57&deg; Fahr.), whereas during
the day the temperature was hot&mdash;max. 97&deg; F. As
early as 9 a.m. the thermometer already registered 85&deg;
in the shade, and not a breath of wind. The elevation
was 1,150 ft. The sky was in streaky horizontal
clouds to the east, and thin misty clouds to the south&mdash;cirro-stratus.</p>

<p>One of my horses having strayed away a long distance,
we only left that camp in the afternoon after
the animal had been recovered. We rose quickly over
the usual red volcanic sand held down in its place by
the vegetation&mdash;rather an&aelig;mic at that particular spot.
Higher up we again sank in the white and yellow ashes,
with occasional zones covered by small, angular, black-baked
d&eacute;bris.</p>

<p>Ants seemed to flourish happily in that region, for
the ant-heaps were innumerable and of great size,
several with towers about 6 ft. in height, resembling
miniature medi&aelig;val castles.</p>

<p>Having risen&mdash;all the time over grey and white
ashes&mdash;to 1,420 ft., we found ourselves again upon open
campos with a splendid view of the flat-topped range
we had already seen to the north and of another to the
south. At the angle where the northern range changed
its direction slightly there stood a high prominence of
peculiar appearance. The range extended west, where
it ended, into a broken cone&mdash;as I have already stated
quite separated by erosion from the main range. All
along the range in the section between the prominence
at the angle and the terminal cone could be noticed
three distinct level terraces and several intermediate
ones&mdash;not yet well defined nor continuous along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-194" id="Pg_1-194"></a>[<a href="./images/1-194.png">194</a>]</span>
whole face of the range. About half-way along its
length, a semi-cylindrical vertical cut was a striking
feature, and appeared from a distance to be the
remains of an extinct crater. It may be noted that
where that crater was, the range was higher than
elsewhere. Its summit, with an undulating sky-line,
lay to the west of it, no doubt formed by erupted
matter. Other great vertical furrows were noticeable
not far from the crater and to the west of it.</p>

<p>The scenery was getting stranger and stranger
every day. We began to notice solitary domes and
cones in the landscape. That day, in fact, beyond
the great campos we had before us a curious little
well-rounded dome, standing up by itself upon an absolutely
flat surface, at a considerable distance from the flat
tableland which stood on one side, and of which formerly
it evidently made part. Higher mountains, somewhat
nearer to us, were on the south-west.</p>

<p>We had reached the River Corgo Fundo (elev.
1,250 ft.), along the banks of which the lamin&aelig; of red-baked
rock could be observed with thin white layers
between. Above was a lovely green pasture with a
tuft of deep green trees, which looked exactly like a bit
of a well-kept English park. We mounted up again
to 1,430 ft., then went down another descent into a
large plain with campos, upon which grew merely a
few stunted trees. We were still travelling over deep
deposits of sand.</p>

<p>The range to the north of us extended, to be
accurate, from north-east to south-west, and at its
south-westerly end possessed a dome not dissimilar
to the one already described on our previous day's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-195" id="Pg_1-195"></a>[<a href="./images/1-195.png">195</a>]</span>
march. This one was perhaps more rounded and not
quite so tall. It rose above the plateau in two well-defined
terraces, especially on the north-east side, but
was slightly worn and smoothed to the south-west.
On the terminal mound&mdash;clearly separated from the
range by erosion&mdash;seven distinct terraces could be
counted, with some less defined intermediate ones.</p>

<p>In the bed of another stream flowing south&mdash;it was
impossible to ascertain the names of these streamlets,
for there was no one to tell, and none were marked
on existing maps&mdash;another great flow of red lava was
visible. This stream flowed into the Rio das Gar&ccedil;as
or Barreiros, only 500 metres away&mdash;an important
watercourse, throwing itself eastward into the Rio
das Mortes, one of the great tributaries of the upper
Araguaya River.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Rio Barreiros was about 100 metres wide. It was
reached through a thick belt, 100 metres in width, of
trees and bamboos of large diameter, which lined both
its banks. The river flowed swiftly where we crossed it,
over a bed of lava and baked rock, red and black, with
huge treacherous pits and holes which rendered the
job of crossing the stream dangerous for our animals.
There were rapids lower down in the terraced mass of
rock forming the river bottom. The rock, worn smooth
by the water, was extremely slippery. It was only
after we had all undressed and taken the baggage
safely across on our heads&mdash;the river being too deep
for the loads to remain on the saddles&mdash;that we successfully
drove the animals over to the opposite bank.</p>

<p>On the banks I collected some specimens of the
laminated red rock, which had no great crushing
resistance when dry. It could be easily powdered under
comparatively light pressure, and scratched with no
difficulty with one's nails. It was of various densities
of red tones, according to the amount of baking it had
undergone. The superposed red strata had a dip northward
in some localities. The rock was much fissured,
and had either gone through excessive contraction in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-197" id="Pg_1-197"></a>[<a href="./images/1-197.png">197</a>]</span>
cooling or else perhaps had been shattered by some
earthly commotion&mdash;such as must have occurred often
in that region in ages gone by, for, if not, how could one
account for finding scattered blocks of this red rock
resting upon the surface of great stretches&mdash;sometimes
for 20 or 30 kil.&mdash;of uninterrupted sand or ashes which
covered such great expanses of that country?</p>

<p>In the valleys, near water, <i>burity</i> palms were
numerous.</p>

<p>Overhead the sky was always interesting. The
days nearly invariably began with a clear, speckless sky,
but, mind you, never of quite so deep a blue as the sky
of Italy or Egypt. The sky of Central Brazil was
always of a whitish cobalt blue. That morning&mdash;an
exception to prove the rule&mdash;we had awakened to a
thick mist around us, which enveloped and damped
everything. No sooner did the sun rise than the mist
was quickly dispelled. In the late morning, about 10
o'clock, clouds began to form high in the sky&mdash;not along
the horizon, as is generally the case in most countries&mdash;and
grew in intensity and size during the afternoon.
Nearly every day at about sunset a peculiar flimsy,
almost transparent, streak of mist stretched right
across the sky from east to west, either in the shape of
a curved line, or, as we had observed as recently as the
day before, resembling with its side filaments a gigantic
feather or the skeleton of a fish.</p>

<p>In the State of Goyaz, it may be remembered, we
had a more beautiful and complete effect at sunset of
many radiating lines, starting from the east and joining
again to the west, but here we merely had one
single streak dividing the sky in two. When the sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-198" id="Pg_1-198"></a>[<a href="./images/1-198.png">198</a>]</span>
had long disappeared under the horizon, that streak
high up in the sky was still lighted by its rays&mdash;becoming
first golden, then red. The effect was quite weird.</p>

<p>My men went during the night on another fishing
expedition, but with no luck&mdash;partly due to the infamy
of our dogs. They used as bait for their large hooks
<i>toucinho</i>, or pork fat, of which they had started out
provided with a huge piece. They walked off a good
distance from camp to find a suitable spot. Unfortunately,
while they were there the dogs ate up all the
<i>toucinho</i> and the result was that the men had to return
disappointed. There was plenty of game, especially
wild pig and <i>veado</i> (deer).</p>

<p>Alcides had a smattering of botany, which was a
great danger to the company. He knew, he thought,
the uses, medicinal or otherwise, of all plants, herbs
and fruit, wild or not wild. This, in addition to the
greediness of the men&mdash;who, although actually gorged
with food, were always willing to devour anything else
they found&mdash;led once or twice, as we shall see, to the
poisoning of himself and his companions so dangerously
as not only to cause terrible internal pains, but to
bring them all actually to death's door.</p>

<p>I never got poisoned myself, as I generally took
good care to watch the effects of those experiments
upon my men first. Then also in my many years of
exploration I had learnt only too well to beware of
even the most seductive tropical plants and fruit.
Notwithstanding all this, Alcides was really wonderful
at turning out pleasant-tasting beverages from the
stewed bark or leaves of various trees, and of these
decoctions&mdash;in which additional quantities of sugar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-199" id="Pg_1-199"></a>[<a href="./images/1-199.png">199</a>]</span>
played an important part&mdash;my men and myself drank
gallons upon gallons. Many of those drinks had
powerful astringent qualities and had severe effects
upon the bladder, but some were indeed quite good
and innocuous.</p>

<p>During the night I observed a most perfect lunar
halo, the circle, close to the moon, displaying a curious
yellowish red outer fringe.</p>

<p>Since leaving the Araguaya we had been bothered
a good deal nightly by the heavy dew, which absolutely
soaked everything, made all our rifles and axes and
iron implements rusty, and the tents and saddles and
baggage considerably heavier for the animals to carry,
owing to the moisture they had absorbed. In the early
morning we began to get thick cold mist, and it was
about that time that the minimum temperature was
usually registered&mdash;58&deg; Fahr. that particular night,
May 19th. We were at quite a low elevation, merely
1,100 ft. When we started in the morning we found
more sand and volcanic d&eacute;bris over ridges some 100 ft.
or so above the level of the river. A torrent, 15 metres
wide, flowing swiftly W.S.W. on a red lava bed, was
crossed, the mules slipping terribly on the polished rock.
More ashes and sand were found as we ascended to an
elevation of 1,200 ft., from which height we discerned a
much-terraced headland to the east and two streams
meeting and flowing south where we eventually crossed
them. One of those watercourses descended in cascades
over laminated successive flows of lava, between which
thin layers of white crystallization could be seen.</p>

<p>Slightly higher, at 1,250 ft., we sank again in yellow
and grey ashes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-200" id="Pg_1-200"></a>[<a href="./images/1-200.png">200</a>]</span>
Across campos we reached another foaming torrent,
flowing as usual over a lava bed, but this time in a
north-westerly instead of in a southerly direction. That
day we met with many watercourses. Having risen to
1,450 ft., we soon after found another streamlet (elev.
1,230 ft.). Again a red lava-flow was exposed in its
bed and showed heavy upper deposits of grey ashes,
with above them a thick layer of yellow-ochre sand
(1,300 ft.).</p>

<p>The distances on the journey were measured by
a watch, the speed of the animals at the time being
naturally taken into consideration. It was not possible
to use the usual bicycle wheel with a meter attached,
which is used with so much success in the Arctic
regions or in countries where travelling more or less in a
straight line and on a level surface is possible.</p>

<p>Another limpid stream flowing south-west (elev.
1,200 ft.) was reached, then more deep sand and
ashes. After that we came to a thick growth of bamboos
and brush on reaching the banks of a streamlet winding
its way north.</p>

<p>Travelling up and down, all day and day after day,
over those undulations became tedious work&mdash;red sand,
whitish sand, grey ashes, all the time.</p>

<p class="fsc">On the Plateau of Matto Grosso.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(Alcides in foreground.)</p>
<hr />
<p>On the west side, on descending the last prominence
we at last came to a slight variation in the geological
composition of the country. After more white sand
and ashes had been passed, we came upon great
stretches of greenish grey granite exposed in huge
domes and much striated, with parallel grooves on its
surface so deep that they almost looked as if they had
been incised by a sharp tool. These grooves were,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-201" id="Pg_1-201"></a>[<a href="./images/1-201.png">201</a>]</span>
nevertheless, naturally caused by the sharp friction of
sand and water, I think, and also by sand blown over
those rocks with terrific force by winds of inconceivable
vigour. All the way down our descent we travelled
over that striated rock. It had become exposed to
the air, but must have once been buried under sand
and ashes like all the rest of that region. Curious
vertical cracks were to be noticed in several places,
with ramifications from a common centre&mdash;evidently
caused by the concussion of some huge weight which
had fallen from above, perhaps a huge boulder shot
out by volcanic action, which had then rolled farther
down the incline.</p>

<p>The terminal side of the curious range we had on
our right appeared not unlike a fortress with its vertical
walls standing upon a slanting bastion.</p>

<p>At the bottom (elev. 1,200 ft.) of the great dome
of granite we had travelled upon we crossed a stream
flowing south-west, the water of which was quite warm.
The high temperature was due, I think, to the heat
absorbed by the rock exposed to the sun and communicated
to the water flowing over it, rather than to a
thermal origin.</p>

<p>Continuing our journey, we had to the south a great
hollow basin in the south-western end of the range,
with two hillocks between the range itself and the
flat boundary plateau to the south.</p>

<p>The highest point of the hill on which we travelled
was 1,450 ft. above the sea level. Every metre we
travelled westward became more strangely interesting.
We were now upon a conglomerate of bespattered lava-drops
encased in a coating of solidified ashes. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-202" id="Pg_1-202"></a>[<a href="./images/1-202.png">202</a>]</span>
we reached the stream we had to go through a dark
tunnel of dense vegetation, great ferns, giant palms,
creepers with their abundant foliage, and tall trees
festooned with liane. Having crossed this dark
vegetable passage, we emerged once more into lovely
open campos.</p>

<p>Great lumpy globular woolly clouds faced us in
the sky to the west. Horizontal intermittent white
layers were close to the horizon to the east, then three
parallel lines of feathery mist to the north-west. In
quantity of clouds the sky that day would meteorologically
be described as C 4&mdash;which means that four-tenths
of the sky vault was covered.</p>

<p>One could not help being struck in Central Brazil by
the almost absolute immobility of the clouds. One
seldom experienced a strong wind; contrary to what
must have taken place there in ages gone by, when that
country must have been the very home of terrific air-currents
and disturbances on a scale beyond all conception.
It was only occasionally that a light breeze&mdash;merely
in gusts of a few seconds&mdash;would refresh one's
ears and eyes as one marched on. What was more
remarkable still was the sudden change of direction
of those spasmodic gusts of wind when they did come.</p>

<p>From a river (elev. 1,250 ft.) we proceeded over
undulations to 1,550 ft. There we were treated to
an extensive and beautiful view to the west, south-west
and north-west. The elevated sky-line formed by the
plateau and mountains was quite straight, barring
three much eroded mountains standing quite isolated
and at a great distance from one another.</p>

<p>One of these solitary elevations was to the south-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-203" id="Pg_1-203"></a>[<a href="./images/1-203.png">203</a>]</span>west,
another&mdash;the castle-like mountain of great height
we had already observed&mdash;stood due west. Then came
the long flat line of the plateau but for a gentle
convexity at each end. The plateau, dressed in thick
forest, stood in the middle distance to the west-south-west.
Campos of great beauty were prominent on its
slopes and in the two hollows in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>As we wound our way forward we found masses of
ferruginous black rock, black d&eacute;bris, and beautiful
crystals.</p>

<p>The silence of that wonderful landscape was impressive.
The tinkling of my mules' neck-bells was
the only cheering sound breaking that monotonous
solitude&mdash;except perhaps the occasional harsh voices
of my men urging on the animals with some unrepeatable
oath or other.</p>

<p>Filippe, the negro&mdash;to be distinguished from the
other Filippi in my employ, a mulatto&mdash;was mounted
on one of my best mules. He carried a regular armoury
on his back and round his waist, for not only did he
carry his own rifle but also mine, besides a pistol and
two large knives. He rode along, slashing with a
long whip now at one mule then at another. Occasionally
he treated us to some of his improvised melodies&mdash;not
at all bad and quite harmonious, although one
got rather tired of the incessant repetitions. Filippe
was a pure negro, born in Brazil from ex-slaves. He
had never been in Africa. His songs interested me,
for although much influenced naturally by modern
Brazilian and foreign airs he had heard at Araguary,
still, when he forgot himself and his surroundings, he
would relapse unconsciously into the ululations and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-204" id="Pg_1-204"></a>[<a href="./images/1-204.png">204</a>]</span>
plaintive notes and rhythm typical of his ancestral
land in Central Africa&mdash;that of the Banda tribe,
which I happened to have visited some years before.
I identified him easily by his features, as well as by his
music and other characteristics.</p>

<p>Filippe did not remember his father and mother,
nor had he known any other relatives. He had no idea
to what tribe he had belonged, he did not know any
African language, and he had never to his remembrance
knowingly heard African music. It was remarkable
under those circumstances that the Central African
characteristics should recur unconsciously in Filippe's
music. It showed me that one is born with or without
certain racial musical proclivities, dictated by the
heart and brain. They cannot be eradicated for many
generations, no matter what the place of birth may be
or the different surroundings in which the individual
may find himself, or the influences which may affect
him even early in life.</p>

<p>Brazil was certainly a great country for tablelands.
As we came out again into the open, another great
plateau, ending with a spur not unlike the ram of a
battleship, loomed in the foreground to the south.
Yet another plateau of a beautiful pure cobalt, also
with another gigantic ram, appeared behind the first,
in continuation of the two separated plateaux we have
already examined. It was separated from these by a
deep cut&mdash;a regular ca&ntilde;on&mdash;several miles wide, and
with sides so sharply defined that it looked like the
artificial work of an immense canal.</p>

<p>Great campos lay before us in the near foreground,
from our high point of vantage (elev. 1,550 ft.). We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-205" id="Pg_1-205"></a>[<a href="./images/1-205.png">205</a>]</span>
were still travelling on a surface of volcanic d&eacute;bris,
yellow ashes and sand&mdash;forming a mere cap over all
those hills, the foundation of which was simply a succession
of giant domes of lava.</p>

<p>North-west we still had the almost flat sky-line of
a plateau rising slightly in two well-defined steps or
terraces to a greater height in its northern part. What
most attracted me that day was the delightful view
of the Barreiros valley spreading before us&mdash;a view of
truly extraordinary grandeur.</p>

<p>We rapidly descended, leaving to our left the Indian
colony of Aracy. Great granitic and lava slabs, much
striated, were seen on our way down to the river
(elev. 1,200 ft.). The stream was 50 metres wide,
and flowed south where we crossed it. There was a
handsome white sand beach on the left bank of the
river. On the western, or right bank, stood great
volcanic cliffs of boiled and broiled rock, interesting
for the violent contortions they had undergone during
the processes of ebullition, which showed plainly in
their present solidified form.</p>

<p>The river bed itself was one of the usual lava-flows
with huge globular lumps and knots&mdash;but all in a
solid, uninterrupted mass.</p>

<p>We waded chest-deep across the stream, conveyed
our baggage and mules to the opposite side, and then
we all enjoyed a lovely bath with plenty of lathering
soap in the deliciously refreshing waters of the Rio
Barreiros.</p>

<p>The river Barreiros, which had its birth in the Serra
Furnas Corros, to the south-west, entered the Rio das
Gar&ccedil;as&mdash;there 100 metres wide&mdash;a short distance from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-206" id="Pg_1-206"></a>[<a href="./images/1-206.png">206</a>]</span>
where we crossed it. The latter river, by far the
larger of the two and of a very circuitous course,
flowed in a south-easterly direction into the Araguaya.
The Rio das Gar&ccedil;as, which also had its origin in the
Furnas Corros Mountains, had almost a parallel course
with the upper Barreiros from south-west to north-east,
but on meeting the Barreiros suddenly swung
round at a sharp angle towards the south-east, which
direction it more or less followed until it entered the
Araguaya.</p>

<p>We made our camp on the right bank of the Barreiros
River. My men were in a great state of mind
when I told them that perhaps on this river we might
find some Indians. The cautious way in which they
remained as quiet as lambs in camp amused me. I
noticed the care with which they cleaned their rifles
and replenished their magazines with cartridges. I
assured them that there was no danger&mdash;in fact, that
quite close to this place we should find one of the
Salesian colonies.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Bororo Indians</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">While</span> I was reassuring my men an Indian appeared,
bow and arrows in hand. He stood motionless, looking
at us. My men, who had not noticed his coming, were
terrified when they turned round and saw him.</p>

<p>The Indian was a strikingly picturesque figure, with
straight, sinewy arms and legs of wonderfully perfect
anatomical modelling, well-shaped feet&mdash;but not small&mdash;and
hands. He was not burdened with clothing;
in fact, he wore nothing at all, barring a small belt
round his waist and a fibre amulet on each arm.</p>

<p>The Indian deposited his bow and arrows against
a tree when some other Indians arrived. He stood
there as straight and as still as a bronze statue, his
head slightly inclined forward in order to screen his
searching eagle eyes from the light by the shade of his
protruding brow. He folded his arms in a peculiar
manner. His left hand was inserted flat under the right
arm, the right hand fully spread flat upon his abdomen.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to take a snapshot of him
before he moved. Then I proceeded to the interesting
study of his features. They were indeed a great revelation
to me. One single glance at him and his comrades
persuaded me that a theory I had long cherished
about the aboriginal population of the South American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-208" id="Pg_1-208"></a>[<a href="./images/1-208.png">208</a>]</span>
continent was correct, although in contradiction to
theories held by other people on the subject. I had
always believed&mdash;for reasons which I shall fully explain
later&mdash;that South America must be peopled by tribes
of an Australoid or Papuan type&mdash;people who had got
there directly from the west or south-west, not by
people who had gradually drifted there from the north.</p>

<p>Some scientists&mdash;with no experience of travel&mdash;have
been greatly misled by the fact that the North
American Indians are decidedly a Mongolian race.
Therefore they assumed&mdash;basing their assumption on
incorrect data&mdash;that the unknown Indians of South
America must also be Mongolian. This was a mistake,
although undoubtedly migrations on a comparatively
small scale of Indians from North to South America
must have taken place, chiefly along the western
American coast. Those tribes, however, unaccustomed
to high mountains, never crossed the Andes. Whatever
types of Indians with Mongolian characteristics were
found settled in South America were to be found to
the west of the Andes and not to the east. This does
not of course mean that in recent years, when roads
and railways and steamships have been established, and
communication made comparatively easy, individuals or
families may not have been conveyed from one coast
to the other of the South American continent. But I
wish my reader to keep in mind for a moment a clear
distinction between the Indians of the western coast
and the Indians of the interior.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Fine Bororo Type on a Visit to Author's Camp.</p>
<hr />
<p>To return to our man: I was greatly impressed by
the strongly Australoid or Papuan nose he possessed&mdash;in
other words, broad, with the lower part forming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-209" id="Pg_1-209"></a>[<a href="./images/1-209.png">209</a>]</span>
a flattened, depressed, somewhat enlarged hook with
heavy nostrils. In profile his face was markedly
convex, not concave as in Mongolian faces. Then the
glabella or central boss in the supra-orbital region, the
nose, the chin, were prominent, the latter broad and
well-rounded. The cheek-bones with him and other
types of his tribe were prominent forwards, but not
unduly broad laterally, so that the face in front view
was, roughly speaking, of a long oval, but inclined to be
more angular&mdash;almost shield-shaped. The lips were
medium-sized and firmly closed, such as in more
civilized people would denote great determination. His
ears were covered up by long jet-black hair, perfectly
straight and somewhat coarse in texture, healthy-looking
and uniformly scattered upon the scalp. The
hair was cut straight horizontally high upon the forehead,
which thus showed a considerable slant backward
from the brow to the base of the hair. A small
pigtail hung behind the head. The hair at the sides
was left to grow down so as fully to cover the lobes of
the ears, where again it was cut horizontally at the
sides and back of the head. The top of the head was
of great height, quite unlike a Mongolian cranium.</p>

<p>The eyes&mdash;close to the nose, and of a shiny dark
brown&mdash;had their long axis nearly in one horizontal
plane. They were set rather far back, were well cut,
with thick upper eyelids, and placed somewhat high
up against the brow ridges so as to leave little room for
exposure of the upper lid when open.</p>

<p>None of the other Indians, who had gradually
assembled, wore a particle of clothing, barring a tight
conical collar of orange-coloured fibre encircling their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-210" id="Pg_1-210"></a>[<a href="./images/1-210.png">210</a>]</span>
genital organs&mdash;so tight that it almost cut into the
skin. Without this solitary article of clothing no
Indian man will allow himself to be seen by another,
less still by a stranger. But with so modest an attire
he feels as well-dressed as anybody. I think that this
elegant article of fashion must have originated as a
sanitary precaution, in order to prevent insects of all
kinds, and particularly <i>carrapatos</i>, penetrating within&mdash;or
else I was really at a loss to understand of what other use
it could be. They themselves would not say, and only
replied that all Bororo Indian men wore it. The Indians
who had assembled all belonged to the Bororo tribe.</p>

<p>On that, as well as on later occasions, I noticed two
distinct types among the Bororos: one purely Papuan
or Polynesian; the other strongly Malay. The characteristics
of those two different types showed themselves
markedly in every instance. The majority were
perhaps of the Malay type. I was intensely interested
at the astounding resemblance of these people to the
piratical tribes of the Sulu Archipelago in the Celebes
Sea, where, too, one met a considerable amount of
mixture of those two types as well as specimens of
pure types of the two races.</p>

<p>Among the Bororos many were the individuals&mdash;of
the Malay type&mdash;who had the typical Malay eye <i>&agrave;
fleur de t&ecirc;te</i>, prominent, almond-shaped, and slightly
slanting at the outer angle. The nose&mdash;unlike that of
Papuan types&mdash;was flattened in its upper region between
the eyes, and somewhat button-like and turned
up at the lower part&mdash;just the reverse of the Papuan
types, who had prominent aquiline noses with a high
bridge and globular point turned down instead of up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-211" id="Pg_1-211"></a>[<a href="./images/1-211.png">211</a>]</span>
The lips were in no case unduly prominent, nor
thick. They were almost invariably kept tightly
closed.</p>

<p>The form of the palate was highly curious from an
anthropological point of view. It was almost rectangular,
the angles of the front part being slightly wider
than a right angle.</p>

<p>The front teeth were of great beauty, and were not
set, as in most jaws, on a more or less marked curve,
but were almost on a straight line&mdash;the incisors being
almost absolutely vertical and meeting the side teeth
at an angle of about 60&deg;. The upper teeth overlapped
the lower ones.</p>

<p>The chin was well developed&mdash;square and flattened
in the Papuan types, but receding, flat and small in
the Malay types.</p>

<p>Both types were absolutely hairless on the face and
body, which was partly natural and partly due to the
tribal custom of pulling out carefully, one by one,
each hair they possessed on the upper lip and upon
the body&mdash;a most painful process. The women&mdash;as we
shall see&mdash;in sign of deep mourning, also plucked out
each hair of the scalp.</p>

<p>A striking characteristic of the head&mdash;in Papuan
types&mdash;was the great breadth of the maximum transverse
of the head, and the undue prominence of the
supra-orbital ridges. Also, the great height of the
forehead and its great width in its upper part were
typical of the race. The maximum antero-posterior
diameter of the skull was equal, in many cases, to the
vertical length of the head, taken from the angle of
the jaw to the apex of the skull.</p>

The ears nearly invariably showed mean, under-developed
lobes, but, strangely enough, were otherwise
well shaped, with gracefully defined and chiselled curves.
They were not unduly large, with a wonderfully well-formed
concha, which fact explained why the acoustic
properties of their oral organs were perfect. They
made full use of this in long-distance signalling by means
of acute whistles, of which the Bororos had a regular code.</p>

<p>The favourite form of earring adopted by the
Bororos was a brass ring with a metal or shell crescent,
not unlike the Turkish moon, but I do not think that
this ornament was of Bororo origin. Very likely it
was suggested by the cheap jewellery imported into
Brazil by Turkish and Syrian traders.</p>

<p>They displayed powerful chests, with ribs well
covered with flesh and muscle. With their dark yellow
skins they were not unlike beautiful bronze torsi. The
abdominal region was never unduly enlarged, perhaps
owing to the fact that their digestion was good, and
also because they took a considerable amount of daily
exercise. In standing they kept their shoulders well
back, the abdominal region being slightly in front of
the chest. The head was usually slightly inclined
downwards.</p>

<p>The feet of the Bororos of the Malay type were
generally stumpy, but this was not so with the higher
Papuan types, who, on the contrary, had abnormally
long toes and elongated feet, rather flattened. The
Bororos used their toes almost as much as their fingers,
and showed great dexterity in picking up things, or
in spinning twine, when their toes did quite as much
work as their fingers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-213" id="Pg_1-213"></a>[<a href="./images/1-213.png">213</a>]</span>
The colour of the iris of the Bororo eye was brown,
with considerable discoloration around its outer periphery,
and especially in the upper part, where it was
covered by the lid. The eyes were generally kept half
closed.</p>

<p>The anatomical detail of the body was perfectly
balanced. The arms were powerful, but with fine,
well-formed wrists&mdash;exquisitely chiselled, as were all
the attachments of their limbs. They had quite
graceful hands, long-fingered&mdash;in more ways than one&mdash;and
wonderfully well-shaped, elongated, convex-faced
nails, which would arouse the envy of many a
lady of Western countries. The webbing between the
fingers was infinitesimal, as with most Malay races.
Great refinement of race was also to be noticed in the
shape of their legs&mdash;marvellously modelled, without an
ounce of extra flesh, and with small ankles.</p>

<p>The Bororos divided themselves into two separate
families&mdash;the Bororo Cerados and the Bororo Tugaregghi.
The first descended from Baccoron; the second claimed
descent from Ittibori. Baccoron lived where the sun
set, in the west; Ittibari dwelt in the east.</p>

<p>I heard a strange legend in connection with their
origin, in which they seemed proud of their descent
from the jaguar&mdash;which to them represented the type
of virility. A male jaguar, they said, had married a
Bororo woman.</p>

<p>A sensible custom existed among the Bororos, as
among the Tuaregs of the Sahara desert in Africa. The
children took the name of the mother and not of the
father. The Bororos, like the Tuaregs, rightly claimed
that there could be no mistake as to who the mother of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-214" id="Pg_1-214"></a>[<a href="./images/1-214.png">214</a>]</span>
a child was, but that certainty did not always apply to
the father. This was decidedly a sensible law among
the Bororos, who were most inconstant in their affections.
They were seldom faithful to their wives&mdash;at
least, for any length of time.</p>

<p>The Bororos were not prolific. They frequently
indulged in criminal practices in order to dispose of
their young&mdash;either by strangulation at birth or soon
after, or by drugging their women before the birth
of the child. The young, when allowed to live, took
milk from their mothers until the ages of five or six
years. The parents were extremely kind to their
children; indeed, they were extraordinarily good-natured
and considerate. Eight days after birth they
perforated the lower lip of male children and inserted
a pendant, taking that opportunity to give a name to
the child. The lobes of the ears were only perforated
at the age of ten or twelve.</p>

<p>It was only at the age of about twenty that men
were allowed to marry.</p>

<p>I found among the Bororos an interesting custom
which I had seen but once before&mdash;in Central Asia, on
the slopes of the Himalaya Mountains, among the
Shoka tribesmen. I am referring to the "clubs"&mdash;called
by the Bororos <i>Wai manna ghetgiao</i>. There the
young men and girls went not only with the object of
selecting a wife or husband, but also to get thoroughly
acquainted and see if the mate selected were suitable
or not. The men sat on one side of the club-house&mdash;a
mere hut&mdash;the women on the other. In a way, these
clubs prevented hasty marriages, for the men were
given plenty of time to study their prospective brides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-215" id="Pg_1-215"></a>[<a href="./images/1-215.png">215</a>]</span>
and the girls their future husbands. Curiously enough,
in the Bororo country it was generally the woman who
proposed to the man. When the official engagement
was made the man proceeded to the hut of his sweetheart
and brought a gift of food for her and her mother.
If the gifts were accepted there was no other formality
to be gone through, and the matrimonial ceremony was
indeed of the simplest kind. The man took away the
girl to his hut and they were man and wife.</p>

<p>The <i>cuisine</i> of the Bororos was not attractive to
European palate, ears or eyes. One of the favourite
dishes of the Bororos, served on grand occasions, was
the <i>mingao</i>, or Indian corn chewed up into a paste
inside their mouths by women and then displayed before
the guests in earthen pots filled with fresh water, in
which it was then cooked.</p>

<p>The Bororos maintained that the sun, <i>Cervado</i>, and
the moon, <i>Ittary</i>, were two brothers, both being males.</p>

<p>They believed in a superior Being&mdash;the essence of
goodness and kindness&mdash;a Being who will never give
pain or hurt anybody; therefore the Bororo, who was
really at heart a great philosopher, never offered
prayers to that superior Being. Why pray and worry
one who will never injure us? they argued.</p>

<p>Then they believed in a wicked and revengeful devil,
the <i>Bopp&eacute;</i>, to whom constant attention was paid because
by him was caused all the trouble that humans can
have. Malady, accidents, disaster in love, in hunting
or fishing expeditions&mdash;for all these the devil <i>Bopp&eacute;</i>
was responsible.</p>

<p>Then they had also another evil spirit&mdash;the <i>Aroe
Taurari</i>&mdash;who, they said, often assumed the appear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-216" id="Pg_1-216"></a>[<a href="./images/1-216.png">216</a>]</span>ance
of their ancestors in order to come and watch the
games of the Bororos, such as wrestling and archery.
Wrestling&mdash;in the catch-as-catch-can style&mdash;was one
of their favourite games. They were very agile at it.
Their favourite trick was to seize each other across
the shoulders, each endeavouring to trip his opponent
by a twisted leg round his knee. Children in the
<i>aldejas</i> were playing at this game all the time. In the
Bororo wrestling-matches it was sufficient to be thrown
down to be the loser, and it was not essential to touch
the ground with both shoulder-blades.</p>

<p>The only other game I saw among the Bororos was
the test of strength. It was carried out with a most
striking article&mdash;a great wheel made of sections, each
one foot long, of the trunk of the <i>burity</i> palm tied
together by double strings of fibre. The ribbon thus
formed by them was rolled so as to make a solid wheel
of heavy wood 6 ft. in diameter. The whole was retained
in a circular form by a strong belt of vegetable
fibre. This great wheel was used by the Bororos in
their sports, at festivals, for testing the strength
of the most powerful men. It was so heavy that few
men could lift it at all, the great test being actually
to place it on one's head and keep it there for a
length of time.</p>

<hr />
<p>The Indians of South America, like the Indians of
North America, revelled in decorating themselves with
the feathers of brightly-coloured birds. The red,
yellow and blue giant macaws, fairly common in that
region, paid dearly for this fashion of the Indians.
Many of those poor birds were kept in captivity and
plucked yearly of all their feathers in order to make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-217" id="Pg_1-217"></a>[<a href="./images/1-217.png">217</a>]</span>
hair ornaments of beautiful blue and green plumage
for the leading musician, who rattled the <i>bacco</i> (a gourd
full of pebbles which can make a terrible noise), or else
armlets, earrings or necklaces. Some of the designs
woven with the tiniest feathers of those birds were
quite clever, and required delicate handling in their
manufacture. Ducks, too, supplied many of the
feathers for the ornaments of the Bororos.</p>

<p>Their cooking utensils were simple enough&mdash;merely
a few large earthen bowls, badly baked and unglazed,
the largest of which was seldom more than
2 ft. in diameter. They broke easily, being made
extremely thin.</p>

<p>The Bororos made basket-work by plaiting dried
palm-leaves, but their most interesting work of all
consisted in the really beautifully made fishing nets.
Nearly all the Indians of South America showed remarkable
talent and patience at this work. The strings
were twisted of a vegetable fibre, extremely resisting,
and eminently suitable by its softness and regularity
of diameter.</p>

<p>Whether owing to excitement, indigestion or other
causes, the Bororos had visions, which they attributed
to the <i>Aroe Taurari</i>. In a certain way they were
believers in the transmigration of the soul&mdash;not generally,
but in specific cases.</p>

<p>There were certain Bororos who, by magic songs,
professed to fascinate animals in the forest and were
able to catch them. The <i>barih</i> or medicine-man generally,
assisted in those incantations.</p>

<p>The Bororos were remarkable walkers. They were
extremely light on their feet and had a springy gait,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-218" id="Pg_1-218"></a>[<a href="./images/1-218.png">218</a>]</span>
most graceful to watch. A striking characteristic of
these people was that, when standing&mdash;unlike nearly
every other tribe of savages I have seen&mdash;they spread
their toes outward instead of keeping both feet parallel.
To a lesser extent the feet were held in that position
also when walking. The suppleness of their bodies
gave them a great advantage in penetrating with ease
anywhere in the forest without having to cut their
way through.</p>

<p>Both men and women were passionately fond of
dancing, although their dancing had not reached any
degree of perfection. With a strip of <i>burity</i> palm upon
their shoulders they hopped around, monotonously
chanting, with a rhythmic occasional jump, the women
following the men.</p>

<p>The women possessed considerable endurance. They
could carry heavy weights for long distances by means
of a fibre headband resting on the forehead. Under
those circumstances the body was kept slightly inclined
forward. Children were also carried in a similar
fashion in a sling, only&mdash;less practically than among
many Asiatic and African tribes&mdash;the Bororo children
were left to dangle their legs, thereby increasing the
difficulty of carrying them, instead of sitting with legs
astride across the mother's haunches. I was amazed
to see until what age Bororo mothers and sisters would
carry the young upon their shoulders&mdash;certainly children
of five or six years of age were being carried about
in this fashion, while such hard duties as pounding
Indian corn, thrashing beans, and hut-building, were
attended to.</p>

<p>Neither in women nor in men was the power of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-219" id="Pg_1-219"></a>[<a href="./images/1-219.png">219</a>]</span>
resistance in any way to be compared with that of
the tribes of Central Africa or Asia. The Indian tribes
of Brazil impressed one as being strong, because one
compared them with their neighbours and masters,
the Brazilians, who were physically one of the weakest,
least-resisting races I have ever seen. When you
compared them with some of the healthy savage races
elsewhere, the Indians did not approach them in
endurance and quickness of intellect. Do not forget
that endurance is greatly due to brain power and self-control.
The Indian races I saw in Brazil seemed to
me almost exhausted physically, owing perhaps to
constant intermarriage among themselves. The eyesight
of the Bororos, for instance, was extremely bad.
There were many in every <i>aldeja</i> who were almost or
absolutely blind. The others were nearly all short-sighted.</p>

<p>The Bororos removed&mdash;pulled out, in fact&mdash;their
eyelashes one by one, as they believed it improved
their sight, especially for seeing at long distances. They
all suffered more or less from complaints of the eyes.
Indeed, I have seldom found races whose members
had eyes in such poor condition. Conjunctivitis was
the most prevalent form of eye disease. Ophthalmia
was frequently met with. They seemed to have no
efficacious method of curing those complaints, and
the result was that one found an appalling number
of blind or half-blind persons among them&mdash;quite out
of proportion to the small population. The Bororos
did not, of course, know of spectacles or any other
way of protecting the eyes. Even when their eyes were
in a normal condition, they nearly all had some defect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-220" id="Pg_1-220"></a>[<a href="./images/1-220.png">220</a>]</span>
of vision. Squinting was frequently to be noticed
among them, and nearly invariably unevenness of the
eyes. Cataract was common at a comparatively early
age, and they knew no remedy for it. An abnormally
marked discoloration of the upper part of the iris
was constantly to be noticed even in young people.
Among the healthiest I never saw one man or woman
with extraordinary powers of vision such as are most
common among savage tribes of Asia and Africa. The
diseased condition of their blood was also perhaps to
a certain extent responsible for this.</p>

<p>Their hearing was good, but not much more acute
than with the average European&mdash;and infinitely inferior
to that of the natives of Asia and Africa. They
suffered considerably from the most terrible of blood
complaints, general among them, also from leprosy and
various skin troubles.</p>

<p>The Bororos made considerable use of the <i>urucu</i>
plant (<i>Bixa orellana</i> L.) which they called <i>nonoku</i>, from
the fruit of which they obtained a brilliant red colouring
matter for tinting their bows and arrows. The shell
of the fruit contained a number of shiny seeds, which,
when squashed, exuded a vivid red juice. It adhered
easily to the skin of the forehead and cheeks, for which
purpose the Indians also extensively used it.</p>

<p>The black paint which the Indians used for smearing
themselves across the forehead, cheeks, and upon the
shoulders, from side to side, was made to stick to
the skin and shine by mixing it with a resin.</p>

<p>The Bororos of the Rio Barreiros district carried
five arrows each with them, but each family of Bororos
used a special colour and also a different number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-221" id="Pg_1-221"></a>[<a href="./images/1-221.png">221</a>]</span>
arrows, so that no particular rule could be laid down
for the entire tribe. The red-tinted arm-band which
most men wore was called the <i>aguasso</i>.</p>

<p>Before starting on a hunting expedition of importance
the Bororos usually indulged in a feast.</p>

<p>I took a great number of thumb-marks among
them, some of which were remarkable for the precision
of the spiral lines from the central point, all over
the thumb point. Others in the longer thumbs showed
a peculiar deviation in the curve at the end, near the
point of the thumb. Where the lines began to deviate,
the triangle formed was filled in by other lines joining
those of the spiral at sharp angles.</p>

<p>The experiments with the dynamometer in order to
measure their strength, the anthropometric measurements
with a calliper, and the printing of the thumb-marks,
caused the Bororos first of all great anxiety,
then boisterous amusement. They looked upon it
all as utter nonsense&mdash;in a way I did not blame them&mdash;and
repeatedly asked why I did it. I told them
that I did it to find out where they came from.</p>

<p>"We are not monkeys," said they; "we do not
walk on our hands. If that is your object you should
look at our foot-marks on the ground, not at the marks
of our hands!"</p>

<p>With these words, from a tracker's point of view,
the local wit set the entire company in shrieks of
laughter at his quick repartee.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said I; "but with the thumb-marks
I may perhaps trace, not only where you come from,
but also where your great-grandfather, who is now
dead, came from."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-222" id="Pg_1-222"></a>[<a href="./images/1-222.png">222</a>]</span>
That was too much for them. All had been anxious
to make a smudge with smoke-black upon my note-book.
Now they all refused to do any more thumb-marking,
and walked away; but I had fortunately
already finished the work I needed from them.</p>

<p>The Bororos&mdash;in fact, most Indian tribes of Central
Brazil&mdash;knew nothing whatever of navigation. This
was chiefly due to the fact that all the woods of Central
Brazil had so high a specific gravity that not one of
them would float. Hence the impossibility of making
rafts, and the greatly increased difficulty in making
boats. As for making dug-outs, the Indians had
neither the patience nor the skill nor the tools to cut
them out of solid trees. Moreover, there was really
no reason why the Indians should take up navigation
at all when they could do very well without it. They
could easily get across the smaller streams without
boats, and they were too timid to go and attack inimical
tribes on the opposite banks of unfordable rivers.
Besides, the Indians were so few and the territory at
their entire disposal so great, that there was no temptation
for them to take up exploring, particularly by
water.</p>

<p>They were all good swimmers. When the river
was too deep to ford they merely swam across; or else,
if the river were too broad and swift, they improvised
a kind of temporary raft with fascines or bundles of
dried <i>burity</i> leaves, to which they clung, and which
they propelled with their feet. These fascines were
quite sufficient to keep them afloat for a short time,
enabling them also to convey a certain amount of goods
across the water.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-223" id="Pg_1-223"></a>[<a href="./images/1-223.png">223</a>]</span>
In other countries, such as in Central Africa among
the Shilucks and the Nuers of the Sobat River (Sudan),
and the natives on Lake Tchad, I have seen a similar
method adopted in a far more perfected fashion. The
Shilucks, for instance, cleverly built big boats of fascines&mdash;large
enough to carry a great number of warriors.
Such was not the case with the bundles of <i>burity</i> of
the Indians&mdash;which merely served for one or at the
most two people at a time, and then only until the
bundle became soaked, when it went to the bottom.</p>

<p class="fsc">Bororo Indians.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bororos were superstitious to a degree. They
believed in evil spirits. Some of these, they said,
inhabited the earth; others were invisible and lived
"all over the air," to use their expression. The aerial
ones were not so bad as those on earth. It was to the
latter that their invocations were made&mdash;not directly,
but through a special individual called the <i>barih</i>, a
kind of medicine man, who, shouting at the top of his
voice while gazing skyward, offered gifts of food, meat,
fish and grain to the <i>bopp&eacute;</i> or spirits invoked. There
were two kinds of <i>barih</i>: a superior one with abnormal
powers, and an inferior one. The <i>barih</i> eventually
pretended that the spirit had entered his body. He
then began to devour the food himself, in order to
appease the hunger of his internal guest and become
on friendly terms with him. The wife of the <i>barih</i>,
who on those occasions stood by his side, was generally
asked to partake of the meal, but only after the <i>barih</i>
had half chewed the various viands, when he gracefully
took them with his fingers from his own mouth and
placed them between the expectant lips of his better
half. She sometimes accepted them&mdash;sometimes not.
All according to her appetite, I suppose, and perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-225" id="Pg_1-225"></a>[<a href="./images/1-225.png">225</a>]</span>
to the temporary terms on which she was that day with
her husband.</p>

<p>The Bororos, curiously enough, spoke constantly of
the hippopotamus&mdash;<i>ajie</i>, as they called it&mdash;and even imitated
to perfection the sounds made by that amphibious
animal. This was indeed strange, because the hippopotamus
did not exist in South America, nor has it ever
been known to exist there. The women of the Bororos
were in perfect terror of the <i>ajie</i>, which was supposed
to appear sometimes breaking through the earth.
Personally, I believed that the <i>ajie</i> was a clever ruse
of the Bororo men, in order to keep their women at
home when they went on hunting expeditions. Boys
were trained to whirl round from the end of a long
pole a rectangular, flat piece of wood attached to a
long fibre or a string. Its violent rotation round the
pole, with the revolutions of the tablet around itself
at different speeds, reproduced to perfection the sounds
of blowing and snorting of the hippopotamus. The
whizzing of this device could be heard at astonishing
distances. The credulous women were rendered absolutely
miserable when they heard the unwelcome
sounds of the <i>ajie</i>, and, truly believing in its approach,
retired quickly to their huts, where, shivering with
fright, they cried and implored to have their lives spared.</p>

<p>The boy who whirled the magic tablet was, of
course, bound to keep the secret of the <i>ajie</i> from the
women. Let me tell you that one of the chief
virtues of the Bororo men, old and young, was the
fidelity with which they could keep secrets. The
youngest children were amazing at keeping secrets even
from their own mothers. There were things that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-226" id="Pg_1-226"></a>[<a href="./images/1-226.png">226</a>]</span>
Bororo women were not allowed to know. Boys
attended the tribal meetings of men, and had never
been known to reveal the secrets there discussed either
to their sisters or mothers.</p>

<p>When I said it was a virtue, I should have added
that that virtue was a mere development of an inborn
racial instinct. Young and old among the Bororo
were extremely timid and secretive by nature. They
feared everybody&mdash;they were afraid of each other.
It was sufficient to watch their eyes&mdash;ever roaming,
ever quickly attracted and pointing sharply at anything
moving anywhere around&mdash;to be satisfied of the
intense suspiciousness of these people.</p>

<p>The Bororos were restless nomads and could never
settle anywhere. They were always on the move&mdash;hunting,
fishing, and formerly on warlike expeditions
with other tribes. They showed great skill with their
arrows, which they threw with wonderful accuracy
even under conditions of unusual difficulty. When
fishing, for instance, they showed remarkable calculating
powers when the line of vision became deviated
by the surface of the water and made it difficult to
judge the exact position of the fish at different depths,
quite removed from where the eye saw it. Their long
arrows had a double-barbed bone head, which was
poisoned when fighting men.</p>

<p>The Bororos were not quarrelsome by nature; on
the contrary, they were dignified and gentle. They
always avoided fighting. It was only when driven to
it, or when hunted down and attacked, that they naturally
endeavoured to defend themselves. This has
brought upon them the reputation of being barbarous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-227" id="Pg_1-227"></a>[<a href="./images/1-227.png">227</a>]</span>
and cruel savages. Even among themselves they
seldom quarrelled; they never offended one another
with words. They had great respect for their elders.</p>

<p>At night the men collected in the village. One of
them spoke aloud to the crowd, delivering a regular
lecture on the events of the day, their hunting or
fishing adventures, or tribal affairs. The greatest
attention was paid to the orator, and only after his
speech was over a warm but orderly discussion followed.</p>

<p>When a Bororo man was angry with another he
would not descend to vulgar language, but he generally
armed himself with a bony spike of that deadly fish,
the <i>raja</i> (<i>Rhinobates batis</i>) or <i>mehro</i>, as it was called
in the Bororo language, which he fastened to a wristlet.
With it he proceeded in search of his enemy, and on
finding him, inflicted a deep scratch upon his arm.
This was considered by the Bororos the greatest insult
a man could offer.</p>

<p>Women, as in most other countries, quarrelled more
than men. Not unlike their Western sisters, they
always&mdash;under such circumstances&mdash;yelled at the top
of their voices, and then resorted to the effective and
universal scratching process with their long sharp nails.</p>

<p>It will be judged from this that it will not quite
do to put down the Bororos as being as tame as lambs.
Indeed, it was sufficient to look at their faces to be
at once struck by the cruel expression upon them.
They prided themselves greatly on having killed
members of rival tribes, and more still upon doing
away with Brazilians. In the latter case it was pardonable,
because until quite recently the Brazilians have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-228" id="Pg_1-228"></a>[<a href="./images/1-228.png">228</a>]</span>
slaughtered the poor Indians of the near interior regions
in a merciless way. Now, on the contrary, the Brazilian
Government goes perhaps too far the other way in its
endeavour to protect the few Indians who still remain
within the Republic.</p>

<p>The more accessible tribes, such as the insignificant
ones on the Araguaya, were having a good time&mdash;valuable
presents of clothes they did not want, phonographs,
sewing machines, fashionable hats, patent
leather shoes, automatic pistols and rifles being showered
upon them by expensive expeditions specially sent out
to them. It no doubt pleased an enthusiastic section
of the Brazilian public to see a photograph of cannibal
Indians before they met the expedition, without a
stitch of clothing upon their backs&mdash;or fronts to be
accurate&mdash;and by its side another photograph taken
half an hour later and labelled "Indians civilized and
honoured citizens of the Republic," in which you saw
the same Indians, five or six, all dressed up and, it may
be added, looking perfectly miserable, in clothes of the
latest fashion. It would have been interesting to
have taken a third photograph an hour after the second
picture had been taken, in order to show how soon
civilization&mdash;if donning a pair of trousers and shoes
and a collar and tie can be called being civilized&mdash;can
be discarded.</p>

<p class="fsc">Bororo Men.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(The aprons are not actually worn.)</p>
<hr />
<p>The news had spread by word of mouth down the
Araguaya many months ahead that a Brazilian expedition
would be sent out with gifts, in order to befriend
the Indians&mdash;supposed to be innumerable: only a few
dozens, all counted, in reality. Seeing no expedition
arrive, the Indians&mdash;five or six&mdash;proceeded to travel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-229" id="Pg_1-229"></a>[<a href="./images/1-229.png">229</a>]</span>
some hundreds of miles to go and find it. The expedition
for lack of money had remained stuck in a certain
town. It was in that town that the valuable photographs
were taken. No sooner had they said good-bye
to their generous donors than the Indians left
the city, quickly removed their clothes, which they
exchanged for a few drinks of <i>aguardente</i> (fire-water),
and, as naked as before, returned to the shores of their
beloved river.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the movement of the Brazilian Government
was extremely praiseworthy and did it great
credit. Like all movements of that kind it was bound
to go to excesses in the beginning, especially in Brazil,
where people were very generous when they were
generous at all. So that so far the fault has been on
the right side. It will undoubtedly prevent in the
future much severe, even cruel treatment which has
been bestowed on the Indians.</p>

<p>It was only a great pity&mdash;a very great pity&mdash;that
this movement for the protection of the Indians had
been started when there were few pure Indians&mdash;almost
none&mdash;left to protect. According to Brazilian
statements, the wild Indians of Central Brazil amounted
to some fifteen or twenty millions or thereabouts! A
few&mdash;very few&mdash;thousands, perhaps only hundreds,
would be nearer the truth. There were no great tribes
left in their absolutely wild state anywhere in Brazil.
There were a few small tribes or families scattered here
and there, but it was seldom that these tribes numbered
more than twenty or thirty members. If the tribe
numbered fifty individuals it was already a large tribe.
Most of them contained merely six or eight members.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-230" id="Pg_1-230"></a>[<a href="./images/1-230.png">230</a>]</span>
So that really, in the population of Brazil, these tribes,
instead of being the chief factor, were in fact a negligible
quantity. It would be rash to make a statement as to
the exact number of wild Indians in Brazil, for in a
country so big&mdash;larger, as I have already stated, than
the United States of America, Germany, Portugal, and a
few other states taken together&mdash;and most of which
was little known or absolutely unknown&mdash;it was not
easy to produce an exact census.</p>

<p>During my journey, which crossed that immense
country in a zigzag from one end to the other in its
broader width, and covered all the most important
regions of the Republic, I became assured that few
indeed were the pure Indians to be found in Central
Brazil. One went hundreds and hundreds of miles
without meeting signs of them; and that in localities
where they were supposed to be swarming. The
Bororos&mdash;a few dozens of them, all counted, in two or
three different subdivisions&mdash;were perhaps the strongest
wild tribe in all the immense State of Matto Grosso.</p>

<p>As I have said, I was greatly impressed, from my
first contact with the Bororos, by the strongly Polynesian
appearance of some of them. The more specimens
I saw of them the more I became convinced
that they were of the same race. In fact, more: I
began to speculate whether the people of Australia
and Polynesia had migrated here or whether it was
just the other way&mdash;which theory might also be
plausibly upheld&mdash;viz. that the people of Central South
America had migrated to the west, into Polynesia and
Australia. Many theories have been expounded of
how races always follow certain rules in their migrations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-231" id="Pg_1-231"></a>[<a href="./images/1-231.png">231</a>]</span>
but in my own experience I do not invariably find that
those theories are always correct. Again, it does not
do to rely too much on the resemblance of words in
establishing a relationship between two or more races.
Nor, indeed, can one trust absolutely to the resemblance
in the rudimentary ornamentation of articles of use.
If you happen to be a student of languages, and have
studied dozens of them, you will soon discover how far
words will travel across entire continents. They can
often be traced back to their origin by the knowledge
of intermediate languages through which, with distortions,
those words have passed. In Central Africa I
actually heard words of Mongolian origin, and not
only that, but even traced Mongolian characteristics in
the type of the ruling classes of natives, as well as
in the construction of their language.</p>

<p>It is easy to be occasionally misled. I remember
on my journey across Africa how amazed I was at
first at hearing some Tonkinese expressions used by
the native cannibals. I really could not get over my
amazement until I learnt that some years previously
a number of Tonkinese convicts had been sent up the
Congo and Ubanghi rivers by the French. Several of
them had lived in that particular village of cannibals
for some years. Hence the adoption of certain words
which had remained in frequent use, whereas the Tonkinese
individuals had disappeared.</p>

<p>I took special care in Brazil, when making a vocabulary
of the Bororo and other Indian languages, to select
words which I ascertained were purely Indian and had
not been contaminated either by imported Portuguese
words or words from any other language. I was much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-232" id="Pg_1-232"></a>[<a href="./images/1-232.png">232</a>]</span>
struck by the extraordinary resemblance of many words
in the language of the Indians of Central Brazil to
the Malay language and to languages of Malay origin
which I had learnt in the Philippine Islands and the
Sulu Archipelago.</p>

<p>For instance: the Sun, which is called in Malay
<i>mata-ari</i>, usually abbreviated into <i>'ari</i>, was in the
Bororo language <i>metiri</i>, and in the language of the
Apiacar Indians of the Arinos-Juruena river, <i>ahra</i>, which
indeed closely resembles the Malay word. Moreover, the
word <i>ahri</i> in the Bororo language indicated the <i>moon</i>&mdash;a
most remarkable coincidence. It became slightly distorted
into <i>zahir</i> in the Apiacar language.</p>

<p>Water, which is <i>poba</i> in Bororo and <i>&uuml;ha</i> in Apiacar,
was curiously enough <i>&uuml;haig</i> in the Bagobo language
(Mindanao Island), <i>po-heh</i> or <i>bo-heh</i> in the Bajao
language (Mindanao Island), <i>ayer</i> in Malay, and <i>uhayeg</i>
in Tiruray (west coast of Mindanao Island, Philippine
Archipelago).</p>

<p>Father was <i>bapa</i> in Malay, and <i>pao</i> in Bororo.
Many were the words which bore a slight resemblance,
as if they had been derived from the same root. <i>Langan</i>,
arm, in Malay, was <i>ankan-na</i> or <i>akkan-na</i>. Ear, in the
Ilocano language (Philippine Archipelago) was <i>cabayag</i>;
<i>aviyag</i> in Bororo. Hair in Ilocano, <i>b&#335;&#335;k</i>, in Manguianes
<i>bohoc</i>, and in Sulu (Sulu Archipelago) <i>buhuc</i>; in Bororo
it was <i>akkao</i>, which might easily be a corruption of the
two former words.</p>

<p class="fsc">Bororo Warriors.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was greatly interested, even surprised, to find that
although those Indians lived thousands of miles on every
side from the sea, and had never seen it, yet they
talked of the <i>pobbo mae re u</i>&mdash;the immense water;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-233" id="Pg_1-233"></a>[<a href="./images/1-233.png">233</a>]</span>
(<i>pobbo</i>, water; <i>mae</i>, great; <i>re</i>, the; <i>u</i>, an expression
of magnification such as our <i>oh</i>).</p>

<p>It was also interesting to note that they had specific
words for water of streams&mdash;words which we do not
possess in the English language, complete as our
language is&mdash;such as down-stream, and up- or against-stream&mdash;like
the French <i>en aval</i> and <i>en amont</i>. The
Bororo used <i>tche begki</i>, down-stream, and <i>tcheo bugkii</i>,
up-stream.</p>

<p>The Bororo language was rudimentary in a way,
yet most complete&mdash;extremely laconic, with innumerable
contractions. The construction of sentences and
the position of the verb were not unlike those of Latin
languages.</p>

<p>The chief wealth of the Bororo language consisted
in its nouns. Like all savage languages, it was
wonderfully rich in botanical and zoological terms.
The gender was formed by a suffix, the masculine differing
from the feminine.</p>

<p>There were in the Bororo language three genders,
masculine, feminine and neuter. The masculine was
formed by adding the words <i>chireu</i>, <i>curi</i>, or <i>curireu</i>, to
the noun; the feminine by the suffixes <i>chireuda</i> and
<i>curireuda</i>. There were many words which were used
unaltered for either gender. In the case of animals, the
additional words <i>medo</i>, male, or <i>aredo</i>, female, clearly
defined the sex in specific cases where the names would
otherwise be ambiguous. Inanimate objects had no
sex, and were therefore neuter.</p>

<p>Most nouns had a plural as well as a singular, but
there were exceptions to this rule, such as names of
certain plants and animals, the sky, the wind, etc.;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-234" id="Pg_1-234"></a>[<a href="./images/1-234.png">234</a>]</span>
not to count things which were generally taken collectively,
such as flies&mdash;<i>ruque</i>; macaw or macaws, <i>nabure</i>,
etc.</p>

<p>The plural was made by the suffixes <i>doghe</i> or <i>maghe</i>&mdash;the
<i>maghe</i> being used principally in possessive cases,
such as <i>tori-doghe</i>, stones; <i>padje-maghe</i>, our mothers.
Exceptions to this rule were the words ending in <i>bo</i>, <i>co</i>,
<i>go</i>, or <i>mo</i>, to which the suffix <i>e</i> was sufficient to form
the plural; whereas in those terminating in <i>do</i> or <i>no</i>,
<i>ro</i>, or other consonants, the <i>o</i> was suppressed and an
<i>e</i> placed in its stead. Example: <i>jomo</i>, otter, <i>jomoe</i>,
otters; <i>cuno</i>, parrot, <i>cune</i>, parrots; <i>apodo</i>, or tucan (a
bird), <i>apode</i>, tucans, etc.</p>

<p>There were a number of irregular exceptions, such
as <i>aredo</i>, wife; <i>areme</i>, wives; <i>medo</i>, man, <i>ime</i>, men.
Perhaps the most curious of plurals was <i>ore</i>, sons, the
singular of which was <i>anareghedo</i> (son).</p>

<p>The words ending in <i>go</i> generally formed the plural
with an interchangeable <i>ghe</i>.</p>

<p>The pronouns were:</p>

<div class='centered'>
<table  class="toc" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Pronouns">
<tr><td align='left'><i>imi</i></td><td align='left'>=</td><td align='left'>I</td><td align='left'><i>sheghi</i> or <i>paghi</i></td><td align='left'>=</td><td align='left'>we</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>aki</i></td><td align='left'>=</td><td align='left'>thou</td><td align='left'><i>taghi</i></td><td align='left'>=</td><td align='left'>you</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'><i>ema</i></td><td align='left'>=</td><td align='left'>he or she</td><td align='left'><i>emaghi</i></td><td align='left'>=</td><td align='left'>they</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>When immediately before a verb these were abbreviated
into <i>I</i> or <i>it</i>, <i>a</i> or <i>ac</i>, <i>e</i> or <i>ei</i>, <i>pa</i> or <i>pag</i>, ta or <i>tag</i>, <i>e</i> or <i>et</i>&mdash;I,
thou, he or she, we, you, they, according to their
preceding a vowel or a consonant. With words beginning
with a consonant only the first syllable of the
pronoun was used.</p>

<p>The verb itself did not vary in the various persons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-235" id="Pg_1-235"></a>[<a href="./images/1-235.png">235</a>]</span>
but it did vary in its tenses by suffixes, sometimes after
the pronoun, sometimes after the verb. In the present
tense the Bororos generally used for the purpose the
word <i>nure</i>, usually between the pronoun and the verb,
with the pronoun occasionally repeated after the
<i>nure</i>; but in general conversation, which was laconic,
the pronoun was frequently suppressed altogether&mdash;similarly
to the frequent omission of the pronoun in
the English telegraphic language.</p>

<p>There were various other forms of pronouns, but
I could not quite define their absolute use&mdash;such as
the <i>tched</i> or <i>tcheghi</i>, which seemed to include everybody,
corresponding to the English <i>we</i> in orations which
includes the entire audience, or the whole nation, or
even the entire human race.</p>

<p>The Bororo language was complete enough, the
conjugation of verbs being clearly defined into past,
present, imperative and future.</p>

<p>The past was formed by interpolating between
the pronoun and verb the words <i>re gurai</i>, generally
abbreviated into <i>re</i>. The imperative was made chiefly
by the accentuation of the words, and was susceptible
of inflexion in the second person singular and plural.
The future was formed by adding, sometimes after the
pronoun, sometimes after the verb, the words <i>modde</i>,
<i>uo</i>, or <i>ua</i>.</p>

<p>At the end of the second volume, in the Appendix,
will be found a vocabulary of useful words needed in
daily conversation which I collected during my visit
to the Bororos. I had made a much more complete
dictionary of their language, in a book which I kept
for the purpose, but unfortunately the book was lost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-236" id="Pg_1-236"></a>[<a href="./images/1-236.png">236</a>]</span>
with a great many other things in an accident I had
some months later on the Arinos River.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was not possible to say that the Bororos shone
in intelligence. It was seldom one found an individual
who could count beyond two. Everything in the
Bororo country was reckoned in couples&mdash;with the
aid of fingers, thumbs, and toes. The learned could
thus reach up to twenty, or ten pair&mdash;but beyond
twenty no Bororo dared venture in his calculations.
They had no written language, no sculptures or paintings,
no carved idols. Their artistic talent seemed
limited to occasionally incising rudimentary representations
of horns, footprints, and line figures on rocks.</p>

<p>They showed great skill in the manufacture of
their arrows, which were indeed constructed on most
scientific lines, and were turned out with wonderful
workmanship. The arrows were from 4 to 5 ft. long,
and were chiefly remarkable for the intelligent and
highly scientific disposition of the two balancing
parrot feathers, gently bent into a well-studied spiral
curve, so as to produce a rotary movement, united
with perfect balance, in the travelling weapon. The
arrows were manufactured out of hard, beautifully
polished black or white wood, and were provided with
a point of bamboo one-third the length of the entire
arrow. That bamboo point was tightly fastened to
the rod by means of a careful and very precisely made
contrivance of split cane fibre.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-236.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-236_th.jpg" alt="Bororo Children." title="Bororo Children." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Bororo Children.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(The horrors of photography.)</p>
<hr />
<p>The Bororos used various-shaped arrow-heads,
some triangular, others flattened on one side with a
raised rib on the opposite side, others triangular in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-237" id="Pg_1-237"></a>[<a href="./images/1-237.png">237</a>]</span>
section with hollowed longitudinal grooves in each
face of the triangle in the pyramid, making the wound
inflicted a deadly one. Others, more uncommon,
possessed a quadruple barbed point of bone.</p>

<p>The favourite style of arrows, however, seldom had
a point broader in diameter than the stick of the arrow.</p>

<p>The music of the Bororos&mdash;purely vocal&mdash;had three
different rhythms: one not unlike a slow waltz, most
plaintive and melancholy; the second was rather of
a loud warlike character, vivacious, with ululations and
modulations. The third and most common was a sad
melody, not too quick nor too slow, with temporary
accelerations to suit words of a more slippery character
in their pronunciation, or when sung in a <i>pianissimo</i>
tone.</p>

<p>The songs of the Bororos could be divided into:
hunting songs, war songs, love songs, and descriptive
songs and recitatives.</p>

<p>They were fond of music in itself, and possessed
fairly musical ears. They were able to retain and
repeat melodies quite foreign to them. Their
hearing was acute enough to discern, with a little
practice, even small intervals, and they could fairly
accurately hit a note which was sung to them. They
had flexible voices, quite soft and musical, even in
conversation.</p>

<p>In males, as far as I was able to judge, baritone
voices were the most prevalent; in female voices,
soprano. Their typical songs were chiefly performed
in a chorus by men only, although once or twice I
heard solos&mdash;which, nevertheless, always had a refrain
for the chorus. The Bororos sang in fair harmony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-238" id="Pg_1-238"></a>[<a href="./images/1-238.png">238</a>]</span>
more than in unison, keeping regular time, and with
occasional bass notes and noises by way of accompaniment.
They possessed no musical instruments of any
importance&mdash;a most primitive flute, and one or several
gourds filled with seeds or pebbles, being, as far as I
could trace, the only two musical instruments among
them.</p>

<p>Their songs contained progressions in chromatic
intervals. Those progressions were not only frequently
repeated in the same melody, but some of the favourite
ones recurred in several of their melodies. They
frequently broke from one key into another, not gradually
or with modulations, but very abruptly. There
were constant and sudden changes in the <i>tempo</i> of
their melodies, accelerations being frequently caused by
excitement in the performers, by incidents occurring,
by anger or other passions being aroused. They had
no set rules&mdash;nor, of course, any written music. The
melodies were sung according to the temporary feelings
of the performers, who occasionally adorned their performances
with variations. Practically they improvised,
if led by a musical talent, as they went along.
Still, mind you, even when they improvised, the
character of the songs was the same, although they
may have added so many variations and embellishments
to the theme as to make it impossible to identify them.
Furthermore, no two choruses ever sang the same
songs alike, nor did the same chorus sing the same song
twice alike. There were in their melodies great changes
in the degree of loudness. Those changes were generally
gradual, although often extremely rapid.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Rattling gourds filled with pebbles, in order to call members of his tribe.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Bororos seemed to be greatly carried away by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-239" id="Pg_1-239"></a>[<a href="./images/1-239.png">239</a>]</span>
music, which had upon them quite an intoxicating
effect. There were certain high notes and chords in a
minor key which had a great attraction for them, and
which constantly recurred in their melodies and their
lengthy ululations. Some of the notes had undoubtedly
been suggested by the song of local birds and by sounds
of wild animals. The Bororos were good imitators
of sounds, which they could often reproduce to perfection.
They were observant with their ears&mdash;much
more so than with their eyes. Even in conversation
the Bororos would often repeat, accurately enough,
noises they heard around them, such as the crashing of
falling trees, of rushing water, of distant thunder, or
foreign words which caught their fancy. I was amazed
at their excellent memory in that direction.</p>

<p>There were no professional musicians in the Bororo
country in the strict sense of the word, the <i>barih</i> being
the only person who might, at a stretch, be put down
as one. Nor was anybody taught music. They were
one and all musicians without knowing it&mdash;or at least
thought they were&mdash;a belief not monopolized by the
Bororos only. They all sang. They learned to sing
gradually by hearing and imitating their elders.</p>

<p>I think that with the Bororos the steps of their
dances had been suggested by the rhythm of the music,
and not the other way round. They preferred music
to dancing, for which latter exercise they showed little
aptitude. Although their melodies would appear appallingly
melancholy to European ears, it did not
follow that they were so to them. On the contrary,
some which had a most depressing effect on me&mdash;and
I felt like throwing at them anything handy but heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-240" id="Pg_1-240"></a>[<a href="./images/1-240.png">240</a>]</span>
to interrupt the melody&mdash;seemed to send the performers
into a state of absolute beatitude. They kept up
those melodies interminably, repeating constantly the
same short theme dozens of times&mdash;hundreds, in fact,
if nothing happened to stop them. When once they
had started on one of those songs it was difficult to
switch them on to another. They loved to hear it
again and again.</p>

<p>The time of their music was "common" time,
slightly modified according to the wording of the song.
It generally altered into a triple time when the words
were of a liquid kind in their pronunciation, and a
dual time when sung low and slowly.</p>

<p>When singing, especially during ululations, the
Bororos swung their bodies forward and backward&mdash;not
unlike the howling dervishes of Egypt&mdash;uttering
occasional high and strident notes. This was generally
done before starting <i>en masse</i> on a hunt, when a feast
also took place.</p>

<p>The women never joined in the songs, but the boys
did. Even if their voices were not powerful enough
to produce lengthy ululations, they spiritedly took part
in the violent undulations of the body.</p>

<p>The Bororos were great lovers of minute detail.
So it was that, in their music, strange, weird effects were
attempted, wonderfully complicated in detail.</p>

<p>Bororo singing occasionally took the form of a
recitative, with the chorus joining in the refrain&mdash;this
principally when chanting the merits of a deceased person,
or during some calamity in the <i>aldeja</i>, or village.</p>

<p>The only musical instruments I was able to find in
the various settlements of Bororos I visited consisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-241" id="Pg_1-241"></a>[<a href="./images/1-241.png">241</a>]</span>
chiefly of single, double, or treble gourds, the latter
with perforations at the two ends, used as wind instruments
and producing deep bass notes. The single
gourd had a cane attachment intended to emit shrill
high notes. Then there were other dried gourds filled
with pebbles which rattled as they were shaken at the
end of a long handle to which the gourds were fastened.</p>

<p>The cane flutes were slightly more elaborate, with
ornaments of rings of black feathers. There was only
one rectangular slit in the centre of the flute, so that
only one note could be produced&mdash;as was the case with
most of their rudimentary musical instruments.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bororo Legends&mdash;The Religion of the Bororos&mdash;Funeral Rites</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bororos believed in spirits of the mountains and
the forest, which haunted special places in order to do
harm to living beings. Those spirits came out at night.
They stole, ill-treated, and killed. In rocks, said the
Bororos, dwelt their ancestors in the shape of parrots.
The Bororos were greatly affected by dreams and
nightmares, which they regarded as events that had
actually happened and which generally brought bad
luck. They were often the communications of evil
spirits, or of the souls of ancestors. The Bororos had
many superstitions regarding animals, which they
individualized in their legends, giving them human
intelligence&mdash;especially the <i>colibri</i> (humming-bird), the
macaw, the monkey, the deer, and the leopard.</p>

<p>The stars, according to these savages, were all
Bororo boys. Let me give you a strange legend concerning
them.</p>

<p>"The women of the <i>aldeia</i> had gone to pick Indian
corn. The men were out hunting. Only the old
women had remained in the <i>aldeia</i> with the children.
With an old woman was her nephew, playing with a
bow and arrow. The arrows had perforated sticks,
which the boy filled with Indian corn. When the boy
had arrived home he had asked his grandmother to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-243" id="Pg_1-243"></a>[<a href="./images/1-243.png">243</a>]</span>
make a kind of <i>polenta</i> with Indian corn. He had invited
all the other boys of the <i>aldeia</i> to come and eat.
While grandmother was cooking the children played,
and among them decided to go to heaven. In the <i>aldeia</i>
there lived an old woman and a red macaw. Both could
speak. The boys, having eaten the <i>polenta</i>, cut off the
woman's arms, cut out her tongue and eyes, and tore
out the tongue of the speaking bird. Having done this,
they went into the forest, where they found a liana
twisted into innumerable steps (in the Bororo language,
<i>ippare</i>, young; <i>kugure</i>, multitude; <i>groiya</i>, step).
They could not speak for fear of drawing attention, nor
ask any one for help. They had taken the precaution
of setting free all the captive birds in the <i>aldeia</i>, and
they had flown away, except the <i>pio duddu</i> (the <i>colibri</i>),
which they took with them into the forest. The boys
gave a long liana, like a rope, to the <i>colibri</i>, requesting
him to fasten it to the top of the highest tree, and
another long liana which he must tie to the sky where
they all wished to ascend. The <i>colibri</i> tied the vegetable
ropes as requested, and all the boys climbed up.</p>

<p>"The mothers, missing their children, went to the
old woman and the speaking macaw.</p>

<p>"'Where are our children?' said they in a chorus.</p>

<p>"No answer. They were horrified when they perceived
the mutilated woman and bird. They rushed
out of the hut and saw the children&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;high,
like tiny spots, climbing up the liana to heaven. The
women went to the forest, to the spot where the boys
had proceeded on their aerial trip, and showing the
breasts that had milked them, entreated them to come
down again. The appeal was in vain. The mothers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-244" id="Pg_1-244"></a>[<a href="./images/1-244.png">244</a>]</span>
in despair, then proceeded to follow their children skyward
up the liana.</p>

<p>"The youthful chieftain of the plot had gone up
last. When he perceived the mothers gaining on them,
he cut the liana. With a sonorous bump, the mothers
dropped in a heap to the ground. That was why the
Bororo women were resigned to see their sons in heaven,
forming the stars, while they&mdash;the women themselves&mdash;remained
the transmigrated souls of their mothers upon
earth."</p>

<p>The Bororos also said that the stars were the houses
of deceased children.</p>

<p>The Bororos believed that the sky vault, or heaven,
formed part of the earth, and was inhabited. They
proved this by saying that the vulture could be seen
flying higher and higher until it disappeared. It went
to perch and rest upon trees in heaven. The Milky
Way in the sky&mdash;the <i>kuyedje &egrave; 'redduddo</i> (literally translated
"stars they cinders")&mdash;consisted for them merely
of the flying cinders from the burning stars.</p>

<p>The sun, they stated, was made up entirely of dead
<i>barih</i>, or medicine-men, who rose daily with red-hot
irons before their faces. The <i>barihs</i> prowled about the
earth at night, and went to the east in the morning on
their return to the sun. The hot irons held by the
<i>barihs</i> were merely held in order to warm the people on
earth. At sunset the orb of day "came down to the
water" beyond the horizon, and from there marched
back to the east. The Bororos maintained that the
heavy and regular footsteps of the sun walking across
the earth at night could be heard plainly.</p>

<p>The moon, which was masculine to the Bororos, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-245" id="Pg_1-245"></a>[<a href="./images/1-245.png">245</a>]</span>
the brother of the sun, and was similarly the home of
<i>barihs</i> of minor importance.</p>

<p>The legends of the Bororos were generally long and
somewhat confused. They were the outcome of extremely
imaginative and extraordinarily retentive minds.
Their imagination frequently ran away with them, so
that it was not always easy to transcribe the legends so
as to render them intelligible to the average reader,
unaccustomed to the peculiar way of thinking and
reasoning of savages. Yet there was generally a certain
amount of humorous <i>vraisemblance</i> in their most impossible
stories. Their morals, it should be remembered,
were not quite the same as ours. There were
frequently interminable descriptive details which one
could on no account reproduce in print, and without
them much of the point of the legends would be lost.
So that, with the confusion and disorder of ideas of the
Bororos, their peculiar ways of expression, and the
mutilation necessary so as not to shock the public,
the legends were hardly worth reproducing. Still, I
shall give here one or two of the more interesting
legends, which can be reproduced almost in their
entirety.</p>

<p>"The sun and moon (two brothers, according to
the Bororos) while hunting together began to play
with arrows with blunt heads, such as those used by
Bororos for catching birds alive. They hit each other
in fun, but at last the sun shot one arrow with too
much force and the moon died from the effects of the
wound. The sun, unconcerned, left his dying brother
and continued hunting; but afterwards returned with
medicinal leaves which he placed on the wound of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-246" id="Pg_1-246"></a>[<a href="./images/1-246.png">246</a>]</span>
moon. According to Bororo fashion, he even covered
the dying brother entirely with leaves, when he saw
his approaching end. When he discovered that the
moon was dead he became frightened and left. That
is why the moon, which when alive was once as bright
as the sun, is now of less splendour. It is because it
is dead, and the sun is still alive."</p>

<p>The Bororos firmly believed that formerly the world
was peopled by monkeys. This was rather an interesting
legend, as it would point out that the Bororos, in
any case, were aware that the world was once inhabited
by a hairy race, which they called monkeys. It is
quite remarkable that a similar legend was found among
many of the tribes of the Philippine Islands and Sulu
Archipelago, and along the coast of the Eastern Asiatic
continent. The Bororos stated that they learnt from
monkeys how to make a fire. Monkeys were their
ancestors. The whole world was peopled by monkeys
in those days. Monkeys made canoes, too.</p>

<p>"One day a monkey and a hare went fishing together
in a canoe in which they had taken a good supply of
Indian corn. While the monkey was paddling the
hare was eating up all the corn. When the corn had
been entirely disposed of, in its irresistible desire to
use its incisors, the hare began to gnaw the sides of
the canoe. The monkey reprimanded the hare, and
warned it that the canoe would sink, and as the hare
was not a good swimmer it would probably get drowned,
or be eaten by fish which swarmed in the stream. The
hare would not listen to the advice, and continued in
its work of destruction. A hole was bored in the side
of the canoe, which promptly sank. The hare being a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-247" id="Pg_1-247"></a>[<a href="./images/1-247.png">247</a>]</span>
slow swimmer&mdash;according to Bororo notions&mdash;was
immediately surrounded by swarms of <i>doviado</i> (gold
fish) and speedily devoured. The monkey&mdash;an excellent
swimmer&mdash;not only was able to save its life, but,
seizing a big fish, dragged it on shore.</p>

<p>"A jaguar came along and, licking its paws, asked
whether the monkey had killed the fish for its (the
jaguar's) dinner.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said the monkey.</p>

<p>"'Where is the fire for cooking it?' replied the
jaguar.</p>

<p>"The sun was just setting. The monkey suggested
that the jaguar should go and collect some dried
wood in order to make the fire. The sun was peeping
through the branches and foliage of the forest. The
jaguar went, and returned with nothing; but in the
meantime the monkey, with two pieces of soft wood,
had lighted a fire and eaten the fish, leaving a heap
of bones. When the jaguar arrived the monkey leapt
in a few jumps to the top of a tree.</p>

<p>"'Come down!' said the jaguar.</p>

<p>"'Certainly not!' said the monkey. Upon which
the jaguar requested its friend the Wind to shake the
tree with all its fury. The Wind did, and the monkey
dropped into the jaguar's mouth, from which it immediately
passed into the digestive organs. The monkey
little by little moved its arms in the close quarters
in which it found itself, and was able to seize the knife
which it carried&mdash;in the most approved Bororo fashion&mdash;slung
across its back. Armed with it, it split the
jaguar's belly and resumed its daily occupation of
jumping from tree to tree."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-248" id="Pg_1-248"></a>[<a href="./images/1-248.png">248</a>]</span>
I was able to record yet another strange legend on
the preservation of fire.</p>

<p>"An otter," said the legend, "in days long gone
by, had with great difficulty lighted a fire on the bank
of a river. The sun first came to warm itself by the
fire, and while the otter had gone on one of its aquatic
expeditions, the moon arrived too. The sun and moon
together, feeling in a mischievous mood, put out the
fire with water not extra clean. Then they ran for
all they were worth. The otter, feeling cold, came out
of the water and, to its amazement, found the fire had
been extinguished.</p>

<p>"'Who did it?' cried the furious otter, wishing
to kill whoever had put the fire out. While its anger
was at its highest the otter perceived a toad, which
was accused of extinguishing the fire because its legs
were as red as fire.</p>

<p>"'Do not kill me!' appealed the toad. 'Put your
feet on my belly.' The request was at once granted.
The toad opened its mouth wide, and with the pressure
of the otter's paws upon its body a burning coal was
ejected from its interior anatomy. The otter spared the
toad's life in recognition of its services in preserving
the fire. That is why the otter and the toad have
been friends ever since."</p>

<p>It was not easy to collect legends from the Bororos,
as only few of them were inclined to speak. The same
legend I found had many variations, according to the
more or less imaginative mind of the narrator.</p>

<p>Here is an extraordinary explanation of the origin
of lightning.</p>

<hr />
<p>"A boy had violated his own mother. His father,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-249" id="Pg_1-249"></a>[<a href="./images/1-249.png">249</a>]</span>
discovering the misdeed and wishing to punish him
severely&mdash;in fact, get rid of the boy altogether&mdash;sent
him to several dangerous places to collect various things
for him, such as wild fruit, etc. The son, fearing disaster,
went to his grandmother for advice. She in
turn called first one bird and then another for their
advice. The father had sent his son to fetch some
small gourds (<i>bappo rogo</i>), which grew floating on or
suspended above the water of a lagoon. But the
lagoon was filled with the souls of deceased Bororos
and evil spirits. In the first instance the grandmother
begged for the help of the <i>pio duddo</i> (or <i>colibri</i>). This
obliging bird accompanied the boy to the lagoon and,
flying over the water, with its beak cut the twigs of
the small gourds, and one by one brought them to the
boy, who had wisely remained on dry land in order not
to be seized by the evil spirits which lay concealed in
the water. When the bird was about to bring the dried
gourds back, the seeds which were inside rattled and
aroused the evil spirits of the lagoon. Up they all
sprang&mdash;but the <i>colibri</i> was too swift for them, and the
gourds were safely delivered to the boy. The boy
brought them to his father, who, amazed at seeing his
son still alive, sent him next to fetch some large gourds&mdash;such
as those used by the <i>barih</i> at funerals and in
high ceremonies.</p>

<p>"The boy went once more to his grandmother, and
she this time recommended him to a dove (<i>metugo</i>).
When the dove and the boy arrived at the lake the
dove cut some large gourds, but, unfortunately, in so
doing made a noise. The souls and evil spirits of the
lake leapt out and dispatched numerous arrows to kill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-250" id="Pg_1-250"></a>[<a href="./images/1-250.png">250</a>]</span>
the dove, but, as luck would have it, dove and <i>bappo</i>
(gourds) escaped unhurt. The boy handed the large
gourds to his astounded father, who could not imagine
how the boy had escaped death a second time.</p>

<p>"The Bororos used in their dances the nails of
wild pigs, which they attached to their feet in order
to produce a noise something like castanets. That
ornament was called a <i>buttori</i>.</p>

<p>"The father next ordered his son to go and bring
back a complete set to form a <i>buttori</i>. For some reason
or other&mdash;according to the legend&mdash;the <i>buttori</i> was also
found suspended over the lagoon swarming with souls
and evil spirits. The grandmother on this occasion
advised the son to accept the services of a large, beautifully
coloured locust&mdash;called by the Bororos <i>mannori</i>.
The <i>mannori</i>, however, made so much noise while on
its errand that it became riddled with arrows from
the angry spirits of the lake. To this day, say the
Bororos, you can see a lot of white spots all over the
body of the <i>mannori</i>. Each marks the spot of a former
wound. But the <i>mannori</i>, too, faithfully delivered the
foot ornaments to the youth. The youth brought them
to his father, who, in amazement and vicious anger,
ordered his son to go with him on the mountain to
seize the nest of the <i>cibae</i> (vulture). According to the
notions of the Bororos, the souls of their dead trans-migrate
into the bodies of birds and other animals.</p>

<p>"The young fellow again paid a visit to his wise
grandmother, who was this time greatly upset. She
handed him a stick and requested him to insert it at
once into the vulture's nest, when they had arrived in
the hollow in the rock where the nest was. The boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-251" id="Pg_1-251"></a>[<a href="./images/1-251.png">251</a>]</span>
departed with his father up the precipitous mountain
side. When they had nearly reached the nest the
father placed a long stick across a precipice and ordered
his son to climb on it and seize the nest. The son duly
climbed&mdash;carrying with him his grandmother's stick.
When he had reached the top the father did all he
could to shake the son down into the chasm, and
even removed the long stick on which he had climbed.
But the lucky boy had already inserted his grandmother's
stick into the crevasse and remained suspended,
while the father&mdash;really believing that he had
at last succeeded in disposing of his son&mdash;gaily returned
to the <i>aldeia</i> (village). The son, taking advantage of
a liana festooned along the rock, was able to climb to
the very summit of the mountain. There, tired and
hungry, he improvised a bow and arrow with what
materials he could find, and killed some lizards. He
ate many, and hung the others to his belt. He went
fast asleep. With the heat, the fast decomposing
lizards began to smell. The odour attracted several
vultures, which began to peck at him, especially in the
softer parts behind (for he was sleeping lying on his
chest and face, as Bororos generally do). The boy
was too tired and worn to be awakened. The vultures
then seized him by his belt and arms, and, taking to
flight, soared down and deposited him at the foot of the
mountain. There the boy woke up, famished. His
supply of lizards had been eaten by the vultures. He
searched for fruit and ate some, but he could not
retain his food owing to injuries caused him by the
vultures. (Here a good portion of the legend has
to be suppressed.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-252" id="Pg_1-252"></a>[<a href="./images/1-252.png">252</a>]</span>
"As best he could, the boy went to look for the
<i>aldeia</i>, but it had vanished. He walked for several
days, unable to find traces of his tribe. At last he
found the footmarks which they had left upon their
passage. He followed them, and came to a fire freshly
made, left by the Indians. He went on until he
identified the footmarks showing where his grandmother
had gone. He made sure they were hers by
the extra mark of her stick on the ground. With the
assistance of a lizard, then of a big bird, then of a rat,
then of a butterfly, he discovered the whereabouts of
the old lady. He was by then an old man. Upon
perceiving his grandmother he again became a boy,
and hurried on&mdash;making a noise so that she might
know him again. She asked another nephew&mdash;'Look
and see who is behind!'&mdash;The nephew turned round
and recognized his eldest brother&mdash;who was also his
father. The grandmother embraced him tenderly.</p>

<p>"The eldest fellow persuaded his grandmother and
brother not to return to the <i>aldeia</i> where he had suffered
so much from the hands of his father.</p>

<p>"'They have made me suffer,' he said, 'and I shall
take my revenge. Come with me, and we shall all be
happy together.'</p>

<p>"They went to a beautiful spot. He climbed a
mountain, and from there proceeded to produce lightning,
thunder and wind, which exterminated the rest
of the tribe in the <i>aldeia</i>. That is why, when the
Bororos see lightning, they say that it is someone's
vengeance coming upon them."</p>

<p>In the Bororo language, lightning was called

<i>gabe</i> when near, and <i>boya ruru</i>&mdash;or deaf sound&mdash;when

<p>The Bororos related an interesting legend of a great
flood or deluge.</p>

<p>"One night a Bororo went with his bow and arrows
to the river in order to fish, at a spot where a cane snare
or trap had been made in the stream. He killed a
sacred fish. No sooner had he done this than the
water immediately began to rise. He was scarcely able
to get out of the water and run up the mountain side,
lighting his way with the torch of resinous wood he
had used in order to attract the fish while fishing.
The water kept almost overtaking him, it rose so rapidly.
He called out to the Bororos of his tribe to make their
escape, as the water would soon drown them, but they
did not believe him and consequently all except himself
perished. When he reached the summit of the mountain
he managed to light a big fire just before the rising
water was wetting the soles of his feet. He was still
shouting in vain to all the Bororos to run for their
lives. The water was touching his feet, when he
thought of a novel expedient. He began to remove
the red-hot stones which had lain under the fire and
threw them right and left into the water. By rapid
evaporation at the contact of the hot missiles, it is to
be presumed, as the legend does not say, the water
ceased to rise. In fact, the water gradually retired,
and the Bororo eventually returned to the spot where
he had left the tribesmen. All were dead. He went
one day into the forest and he found a doe&mdash;which
had in some mysterious way escaped death&mdash;and he
took her for his wife. From this strange union were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-254" id="Pg_1-254"></a>[<a href="./images/1-254.png">254</a>]</span>
born children who were hornless and quite human,
except that they were very hairy. After a few generations
the hair entirely disappeared. That was how the
Bororo race was preserved."</p>

<p>That extraordinary legend was, to my mind, a very
interesting one&mdash;not in itself, but from several facts
which in its ignorant language it contained. First of
all, the knowledge of the Bororos concerning a former
hairy race&mdash;a hairy race referred to in legends found all
over the Eastern Asiatic coast and on many of the
islands in the Pacific from the Kuriles as far as Borneo.
Then it would clearly suggest a great deluge and flood
which most certainly took place in South America in
days long gone by, and was indeed quelled by burning
stones&mdash;not, of course, thrown by the hands of a
Bororo, from the summit of a mountain, but by a
great volcanic eruption spitting fire and molten rocks.</p>

<p>As I have stated elsewhere, there was every possible
indication in Central Brazil that torrential rains on an
inconceivable scale&mdash;naturally followed by unparalleled
floods&mdash;had taken place, in the company of or followed
by volcanic activity on a scale beyond all imagination.
One had only to turn one's head round and gaze at
the scenery almost anywhere in Central Brazil, but in
Matto Grosso particularly, to notice to what extent
erosion and volcanic activity had done their work.</p>

<p>Another curious belief of the Bororos was worth
remembering. They claimed that men and women did
not come from monkeys, but that once upon a time
monkeys were human and could speak. They lived
in huts and slept in hammocks.</p>

<p>The Bororos possessed no geographical knowledge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-255" id="Pg_1-255"></a>[<a href="./images/1-255.png">255</a>]</span>
Beyond their immediate neighbourhood they knew of
no other place, and did not in any way realize the
shape or size of the earth.</p>

<p>They called themselves <i>Orari nogu doghe</i>&mdash;or people
who lived where the <i>pintado</i> fish (<i>orari</i> in Bororo) was
to be found. The Bororos spoke of only three other
tribes: the <i>Kaiamo doghe</i> (the Chavantes Indians),
their bitter enemies; the <i>Ra rai doghe</i>&mdash;the long-legged
people&mdash;ancient cave-dwellers, once the neighbours
of the Bororos, but now extinct; and the <i>Baru
gi raguddu doghe</i>&mdash;a name better left untranslated&mdash;applied
to a tribe living in grottoes.</p>

<p>In the way of religion the Bororos admitted of five
different heavens, in the last of which dwelt a Superior
Being&mdash;a deity called the <i>Marebba</i>. Marebba's origin
was unknown to the Bororos. All they knew was that
he had a mother and a powerful son. Marebba only
looked after the men&mdash;but he was so occupied that when
the <i>barihs</i>&mdash;through whose mediation it was possible to
communicate with him&mdash;wished to be heard, they had
to shout at the top of their voices in order to attract
his attention. Only the higher <i>barihs</i> could communicate
with him, the lower <i>barihs</i> being merely permitted
to communicate with his son.</p>

<p>They also believed in the existence of a bad god&mdash;an
evil spirit called <i>Boppe</i>. Boppe inhabited the mountains,
the tree-tops and the "red heaven." There
were many <i>boppe</i>, male and female, and to them were
due all the misfortunes which had afflicted the Bororos.
Some of the <i>barihs</i> maintained that they had actually
seen both Marebba and some of the <i>boppes</i>. They
gave wonderful descriptions of them, comparing them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-256" id="Pg_1-256"></a>[<a href="./images/1-256.png">256</a>]</span>
in their appearance to human beings. The Bororos
believed that in any food it was possible to find a
<i>boppe</i>&mdash;there established in order to do evil. Therefore,
before partaking of meals, especially at festivals, they
first presented the <i>barih</i> with fruit, grain, meat and fish
in order to appease the anger of the evil spirits.</p>

<p>The Bororos believed in the transmigration of the
soul into animals. They never ate deer, nor jaguar,
nor vultures, because they thought that those animals
contained the souls of their ancestors. The jaguar, as
a rule, contained the soul of women. When a widower
wished to marry a second time he must first kill a
jaguar in order to free the soul of his first wife from
suffering.</p>

<p>They also seemed to have an idea that the <i>aru&eacute;</i>, or
souls of the dead, might reappear in the world and
could be seen by relatives. Men and women all became
of one sex on leaving this world&mdash;all souls being feminine,
according to the Bororos.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Bororo Blind Woman.</p>
<hr />
<p>The apparition of the souls before their relatives
was, of course, merely a clumsily arranged trick of the
<i>barihs</i>. This is how it was done. They made a circle
of branches of trees&mdash;in order to keep the audience at
a distance&mdash;and then erected a large wooden gate, so
arranged that when the souls appeared it fell down in
order to give them free passage. The souls&mdash;generally
not more than two together&mdash;upon being called by
the <i>barih</i>, entered the ring with their faces covered and
hopping with a special step of their own. They did
not respond to prayers or tears, and kept on twirling
about within the ring. The body was that of a woman,
wearing from the waist down a gown of palm leaves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-257" id="Pg_1-257"></a>[<a href="./images/1-257.png">257</a>]</span>
The face was covered by a mask of vegetable fibre which
allowed its owner to see and not be seen. Upon the
head was worn a cap of wax in which were stuck a great
number of arrows, so that it looked just like the back
of a disturbed porcupine.</p>

<p>Naturally those "souls" were merely special girls
dressed up for the occasion. But credulous Bororo
women believed they were actually seeing the souls of
their dead relatives. They worked themselves into a
great state of excitement.</p>

<p>The same implement which was employed by the
Bororos to reproduce the sound of the <i>aigi</i> or <i>ajie</i>
(hippopotamus)&mdash;a board some ten inches long and
three inches wide attached to a string and revolved
from a long pole&mdash;was also used by them to announce
the departure of souls from this world to the next.
The women were ordered to cover their faces or hide
altogether inside their huts when these noises were
produced. Should one be curious enough to inquire
into their origin and look, she was generally condemned
to death&mdash;frequently by starvation. The Bacururu&mdash;or
the Coroado Indians&mdash;believed that, after such an
indiscretion, nothing could save the life of a woman.</p>

<p>Before starting on a hunting or fishing expedition
prayers were offered to the souls of the departed, so
that they might not interfere with the success of the
expedition, and if possible help instead.</p>

<p>The funeral rites of the Bororos were singular. On
the death of a man, a chorus of moans began and tears
were shed in profusion, while some one sang for several
days the praises of the defunct in a melancholy monotone.
The body was covered for two entire days,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-258" id="Pg_1-258"></a>[<a href="./images/1-258.png">258</a>]</span>
during which all articles that belonged to the deceased,
such as bow and arrows, pots, and musical instruments,
were smashed or destroyed. The d&eacute;bris was stored
behind a screen in the hut, where subsequently was
also kept the hearse in which the body was conveyed to
the burial spot. The body, wrapped in a palm-leaf
mat, was then interred in a shallow oval grave just
outside his hut. A wooden beam was placed directly
over the body, and then the hollow was covered over
with some six or eight inches of earth. A few branches
of trees and some thorns were thrown over it to indicate
the spot.</p>

<p>For twenty days in the evening and night moans
resounded through the air. More tears were shed by
the relatives and by the <i>barih</i>, who frequently proceeded
to the grave to pour water on it. On the twentieth day,
while some one set at play the awe-inspiring revolving
board, others proceeded to exhume the body&mdash;by then
in a state of absolute decomposition. The remains
were taken to the stream and the bones cleaned with
great care. The skull was placed within two inverted
hemispherical baskets, whereas all the other bones of
the body were heaped into a third concave basket of
a larger size.</p>

<p>It was on their return&mdash;with moans and chanting&mdash;to
the <i>bayto</i>, or meeting-place in the <i>aldeia</i>, that the
most touching scene ensued. The skull was decorated
with a design of coloured feathers, while those present
inflicted wounds upon their own bodies, shedding blood
upon the basket of remains. The women, moreover,
tore one by one each hair from their heads and bodies
in sign of mourning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-259" id="Pg_1-259"></a>[<a href="./images/1-259.png">259</a>]</span>
After this the skull and bones were placed within
another basket, and were either cremated or thrown
to the bottom of a river. The property of the deceased
was then set ablaze.</p>

<p>I noticed in a hut a skirt made of long palm leaves.
It was donned at funerals. There were also several
long rudimentary flutes, formed by a cane cylinder
with a rounded mouthpiece inserted into another.
These flutes, too, were used only on such mournful
occasions.</p>

<p>The <i>barih</i> received a present from relatives at the
death of individuals in the tribe. The family remained
in mourning from five to six months. The widow, at
the death of her husband, was expected to tear each
hair off her scalp, one by one, until her head remained
as bald as a billiard-ball. She generally did it.</p>

<p>The corpses of women were treated slightly differently.
When a woman died she was buried <i>pro tem.</i>
A feast was given to the tribe. The process of denudation
having been given ample time to leave her
skeleton clean, her bones were collected, and placed in
a special basket and then cremated. The ashes were
scattered to the winds, and so were all her clothes,
ornaments, chattels, smashed to atoms, and articles of
food. Even fowls, if she possessed any, were destroyed.
Usually they were eaten by her friends.</p>

<p>The Bororos did not possess a sense of honour resembling
ours. Theft was not considered dishonourable,
and was not looked down upon nor condemned by
them. If a Bororo liked anything belonging to any one
else, they could see no reason why he should not
appropriate it. That was their simple way of reasoning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-260" id="Pg_1-260"></a>[<a href="./images/1-260.png">260</a>]</span>
and as no police existed among them such theories were
easily followed.</p>

<p>Taking something belonging to a stranger was, in
fact, rather encouraged, and in our experience we had
to keep a sharp watch when Indians came to our camp,
as things disappeared quickly. They seldom took the
trouble to ask for anything; they just took it and ran
away.</p>

<p>The measurements of Bororo heads in the table on
page <a href="#Pg_1-261">261</a>, taken, as an average, from several of the most
characteristic types, will be found of interest, especially
when compared with some from Papuan and Malay
tribes of the Philippine and Sulu Archipelagoes with
whom they have many points in common.</p>

<p>Due allowance must be made for the artificial deformation
of the cranium in the case of the Bororos.</p>

<p>I had no end of trouble in obtaining these measurements,
as the Bororos would not hear of being
measured. They were frightened of the nickel-plated
calliper I used for the purpose. It was quite beyond
them to understand why any one should want to know
the length of their noses. In fact, although many, after
a lot of coaxing, submitted to have other measurements
taken, few of them would let me measure the nose.
None at all would permit me to measure the length of
their eyes, as they feared I should intentionally blind
them.</p>

<p>I met other tribes of Bororos as I went along, and

was still soft, was intentionally compressed and ban-</p>

especially at the forehead and back, so as to
flatten it and produce an abnormal shape of the skull.
In many cases only the back of the head was flattened
by the application of artificial pressure. The elongation
was both upwards and sideways. This deformation
was particularly confined to male children.</p>

<p>When twins were born one was killed or else left
to die in the sun, as they believed that the other could
not live if both were left alive. Murder for them, in
that instance, was a question of humanity.</p>

<p>The Bororos had a perfect horror of natural death.
They were terrified at the sight of a person dying.
Therefore when one of their people was about to expire
they covered him up and placed him out of sight. If
he or she under those circumstances delayed in departing
this life, the departure was hastened by suffocation
or strangulation. The Bororos were too restless, and
could not wait too long for anything.</p>

<p>They were easily suggestionized. Many of them
would make excellent subjects for hypnotic experiments.
The women particularly were extraordinarily
sensitive to animal magnetism. They were much
given to hysterical displays. One of the reasons
which was given me for hastening the death of
moribund Bororos was a curious superstition that the
sight of a dying person would cause the death of women,
particularly if the dying person happened to look in
the direction of one woman present. The women
believed this so firmly that occasionally&mdash;the Bororos
asserted&mdash;women actually became ill and died when
they saw a dead person. This, no doubt, may have
occurred merely by suggestion. Women were never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-263" id="Pg_1-263"></a>[<a href="./images/1-263.png">263</a>]</span>
allowed, under ordinary circumstances, to see dead
people.</p>

<p>When dancing the Bororos sprang on one foot and
then on the other, always hopping about in a circle.</p>

<p>Abnormalities and deformities were frequently
noticeable among them, such as hare-lip, supernumerary
toes and fingers, and hypertrophy of the limbs. Abnormalities
of the genitals were general owing to tribal
customs.</p>

<p>One of the evil spirits most feared by the Bororos
was called <i>aroi koddo</i>&mdash;or "soul that falls." It was a
spirit that came to earth solely for the purpose of
punishing the Bororos. They said that this spirit
was an extremely noisy one and its approach was
announced by terrifying sounds.</p>

<p>The Bororos were frightened of comets and had
about them superstitions similar to those of Europeans&mdash;that
is to say, that their appearance caused illness,
misfortune and death. Solar and lunar eclipses, the
Bororos stated, were merely the result of anger on the
part of evil spirits. "The sun or moon were making
faces because they were angry," was their highly astronomical
explanation of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>The Bororos had a firm belief that some of their
ancestors lived in the sun, others in the moon; and
they said the ancestors caused the sun to make faces
when angry. In the sun also lived the head of all
the <i>barihs</i>, or medicine-men, the intermediary between
humans and spirits; whereas in the moon dwelt only
those who could invoke the souls of the ancestors.
The <i>barih</i> was only capable of communicating with a
<i>barih's</i> ancestors.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The River Das Gar&ccedil;as&mdash;Majestic Scenery</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">I went</span> to call on the Salesian Fathers. Between my
camp and the river Das Gar&ccedil;as, on the right bank of
which the colony stood, there was a great dome of red
volcanic rock with many loose boulders such as we
had seen for the last three days of our journey. The
river was swift and deep. The colony was on the
opposite side of the water. We shouted until an Indian
appeared and took us across in a rickety canoe belonging
to the friars, which he paddled with the stalk of a palm-leaf.</p>

<p>The Salesians were remarkable people, and should
be an example to many other missionaries. Wherever
they went they did not trouble much about making
converts. They taught the natives instead how to
work the soil and how to make all kinds of articles
which might or might not be useful to them as they
became more civilized. The chief effort of the monks
was to teach the natives agriculture, from which&mdash;charity
always begins at home&mdash;the friars themselves
were naturally the first to reap the benefit. At the
same time the natives learned, and earned, and were
made happy. They improved their mode of living and
were, with great softness and patience, not only drawn
nearer to Catholicism but towards white people alto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-265" id="Pg_1-265"></a>[<a href="./images/1-265.png">265</a>]</span>gether.
The Salesians had established on the Rio das
Gar&ccedil;as&mdash;an enchanting spot&mdash;a beautiful farm on
which they grew quantities of Indian corn, sugar-cane,
wheat, and all kinds of vegetables.</p>

<p>Although I am not a Roman Catholic, the Salesians
received me very politely and took the greatest delight
in showing me all over the Mission. It was interesting
to note that everybody was working hard. The Father
Superior himself was busy shaping a big table from a
huge plank of hard wood, and nothing could induce
him to leave his sweating work&mdash;not even to go and have
his meals. Father Colli Agostino was detailed to go
round and explain everything to me.</p>

<p>The Salesians had no trouble with the Indians,
whom they found quite gentle and docile. But they
could never be relied upon. One day the entire tribe
would come and help to work the soil with great vigour;
the next day they would all disappear from the neighbourhood
and no one knew where they had gone&mdash;sometimes
for weeks. They invariably came back,
sooner or later, and, what was more, they were always
welcomed back.</p>

<p>Converting them to Christianity was a different
matter. The Salesians had made little headway in that
direction.</p>

<p>"We are patient people," said Father Colli; "it
will come in time. Already the Bororos are beginning
to join us in the church, where many enjoy singing with
us. They are intelligent and soon learn to sing."</p>

<p>I purchased, at almost prohibitive prices, many
things from the Salesians, principally food for my
animals and men. Of course, in buying one had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-266" id="Pg_1-266"></a>[<a href="./images/1-266.png">266</a>]</span>
realize where we were, which made all the difference in
the price. I was glad to pay them the money and obtain
the commodities.</p>

<p>The Salesians told me that while digging to make
the foundations for one of their buildings they had
found&mdash;only 3 ft. under ground&mdash;in the sandy soil
several earthen pots of great antiquity, in excellent
preservation, as well as a fireplace with ashes and
charcoal. The sand had evidently accumulated in the
valley below there owing to wind and not to water.
The frail pottery, imperfectly baked, would have
crumbled away quickly in moisture.</p>

<p>On May 20th (min. 58&deg; Fahr., max. 85&deg;) we were
again off toward the west, travelling over great domes
of red lava, the higher portions of which were covered
by layers of ashes and red sand. We were at an elevation
of 1,480 ft. in the deep basin of the Rio Barreiros
and Rio das Gar&ccedil;as, but we soon went over three
consecutive ridges, 1,550 ft. above the sea level, with
delicious campos and a <i>bosquet</i> of trees here and there.
In the arc of a circle extending from north-west to
south-west we had in front of us a beautiful view.
Previous to reaching the third ridge, that day, we also
had behind us a wonderful panorama of the great
plateau described in a previous chapter.</p>

<p>On travelling over a fourth elevation we found ourselves
upon another immense dome of red volcanic
rock, blackened on the surface, as if by fire, and with
the peculiar striations we had noticed once or twice
before. In this case there were cross striations as well,
the direction of one set of parallel marks being from
north-west to south-east, of the other set north-east to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-267" id="Pg_1-267"></a>[<a href="./images/1-267.png">267</a>]</span>
south-west, thus forming lozenges, each about 60 cm.
across. All those lozenges were so regularly cut that
the <i>ensemble</i> gave the appearance of a well-made pavement.
Then I noticed some peculiar great cavities
in the rock, like those formed by glacial action. In
fact, on a superficial examination, it seemed almost as
if that region had first gone through a period of great
revolution while in a state of semi-liquefaction owing
to intense heat from fire, after which a sudden and
intense cooling had taken place and covered the country
perhaps even with ice. Whether the immense deposits
of ashes and sand had been formed before or after the
glacial period&mdash;if any such period ever existed in that
particular region&mdash;could be merely a matter of speculation.
In many places the sand, ashes, and red earth
had almost consolidated into easily friable rock.</p>

<p>Where the actual rock was not exposed we had
campos, campos, campos, stretching as far as the eye
could see. Far from being monotonous, one had&mdash;or
at least I had&mdash;a delightful sensation in riding across
those interminable prairies of beautiful green. One
could breathe the pure air with fully expanded lungs,
and in that silent, reposeful solitude one felt almost
as if the whole world belonged to one. We were not
much worried by insects on those great open places;
it was only on getting near patches of vegetation and
near streams that we suffered from the attacks of those
pests.</p>

<p>We saw few trees&mdash;all stunted and weak&mdash;as the
padding of earth over the rocky under-strata did not
permit their roots to go deep down, and therefore they
grew up with difficulty and an&aelig;mic.</p>

Twelve kilometres from the Rio Barreiros we came
to a stream (elev. 1,400 ft.). On our left, rising above
the inclined campos, was a triple undulation much
higher than its neighbours. To the west stood two
twin, well-rounded mounds, that my men named at
once "the woman's breasts," which they much resembled.</p>

<p>We were still marching on deep deposits of ashes,
and, higher, upon semi-hardened sandstone. On the
northern side the twin hills had a different shape.
They ended in a sharply pointed spur.</p>

<p>After going over an ochre-coloured sandy region
(elev. 1,530 ft. above the sea level) we were again on
magnificent undulating campos, dotted here and there
with dark green shrubs and <i>bosquets</i> to the north, north-west,
and north-east.</p>

<p>Beyond, to the north-east, loomed again in the far
distance our mysterious plateau, of a pure cobalt blue
where in shadow. As one ran one's eye along its sky-line
it was almost flat for more than half its length,
then came a slight dip, followed by a terraced dome.
Then again a straight line followed by a slightly higher
and more undulating sky-line with three steps in it,
and a conical end at its eastern terminus. The most
easterly point of all&mdash;the highest&mdash;resembled a castle
with vertical sides. But of this we have already spoken,
at the terminal point of the great divided range we had
passed some days previously. The vertical cliffs of the
plateau, where lighted by the sun, were of a brilliant
red colour.</p>

<hr />
<p>As we approached the twin hills they appeared to
be the remains of an ancient crater. They formed, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-269" id="Pg_1-269"></a>[<a href="./images/1-269.png">269</a>]</span>
fact, a crescent with a broken rocky lower section&mdash;completing
the circle of the crater. I had no time to
go and examine carefully, as it would have meant a
deviation from my route, but that is how it appeared to
me. There were, in fact, extra deep deposits of volcanic
ashes at the foot of the descent before we arrived at
the river Agua Emeindada, where we made our camp
that night, 15 kil. from the Rio Barreiros.</p>

<p>My men went after game that night. Alcides killed
a <i>veado</i> (deer), and we all enjoyed the fresh meat for
dinner.</p>

<p>The clouds (cirro-stratus) were, during the entire
day, in horizontal lines and slight globular accumulations,
the latter in a row and, taken <i>en masse</i>, giving also
the impression of lines just above the horizon to the
west. At sunset we once more saw the glorious effect
of the radiation from the west, only instead of being
straight lines there were, that time, feathery filaments
which rose in graceful curves overhead, like so many
immense ostrich feathers. They joined again in a
common centre to the east.</p>

<p>My men were complaining all the time of the intense
cold at night, and made me feel almost as if I had been
responsible for it. They grumbled perpetually. During
the early hours of the morning their moans were incessant.
They never ceased crying, as hysterical young
girls might do, but as one would not expect of men.
Some of them had toothache&mdash;and no wonder, when
one looked at their terrible teeth and the way they ate.
They devoured pounds of sugar every day&mdash;our supply,
which should have lasted a year or more, having already
almost been exhausted. It was impossible for me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-270" id="Pg_1-270"></a>[<a href="./images/1-270.png">270</a>]</span>
alone, with all the astronomical, geological, botanical,
geographical, meteorological, photographic, anthropometric,
and artistic work&mdash;not to mention the writing-up
of my copious daily notes&mdash;also to keep a constant
watch on the supplies. I had handed over that responsibility
to Alcides. Unfortunately, he was the greediest
of the lot. Every time I warned him not to be so
wasteful, as we should find ourselves dying of starvation,
he and the others made me feel that I was meanness
itself, and that I was only doing it to save money.</p>

<p>I never objected to their eating as much as they
could&mdash;as I have always made it a point on all my
expeditions to feed my men on the best food procurable,
and give them as much as they could possibly devour.
But it pained me to see quantities of good food thrown
away daily, as I knew what it would mean to us later on.</p>

<p>"We are Brazilians," said they, "and like plenty
to eat. When there is no more we will go without food.
You do not know Brazilians, but Brazilians can go
thirty or forty days without anything to eat!"</p>

<p>"All right," said I&mdash;"we shall see."</p>

<p>Forty minutes&mdash;and perhaps not so long&mdash;had been,
so far, the longest time I had seen them cease munching
something or other. Not satisfied with the lavish
food they were supplied with&mdash;heaps of it were always
thrown to the dogs, after they had positively gorged
themselves&mdash;yet they would pick up anything on the
way: a wild fruit, a scented leaf of a tree, a nut of some
kind or other, a <i>palmito</i>, a chunk of tobacco&mdash;all was
inserted in the mouth. It was fortunate that we
took enough exercise, or surely they would have all
perished of indigestion. In my entire experience I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-271" id="Pg_1-271"></a>[<a href="./images/1-271.png">271</a>]</span>
never seen men eat larger quantities of food and more
recklessly than my Brazilian followers did. In the
morning they were almost paralyzed with rheumatism
and internal pains all over the body. Frequently those
pains inside were accentuated by the experiments they
made in eating all kinds of fruit, some of which was
poisonous. Many a time on our march did we have to
halt because one man or another was suddenly taken
violently ill. My remedy on those occasions was to
shove down their throats the end of a leather strap,
which caused immediate vomiting; then when we were
in camp I gave them a powerful dose of castor oil.
After a few hours they recovered enough to go on.</p>

<p>On May 21st the minimum temperature of the
atmosphere was 55&deg; Fahr., the maximum 79&deg;, the
elevation 1,250 ft. at the stream Agua Emeindata. My
men declared again they were half-frozen during the
night and would not go on with me, as it was getting
colder all the time and they would certainly die. When
I told them that it was not cold at all&mdash;on the contrary,
I considered that temperature quite high&mdash;they would
not believe me.</p>

<p>With the temperature in the sun during the day at
98&deg;, most of the aches of the men disappeared, and I
had little trouble with them until after sunset, when
there was generally a considerable drop in the temperature.</p>

<p>We went on. We had a volcanic mountain to the
left of us&mdash;half the crater of a volcano formed of red
lava and friable red-baked rock. In the northern and
central part of the mountain were masses of lava which
had been shot out of the mouth of the volcano and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-272" id="Pg_1-272"></a>[<a href="./images/1-272.png">272</a>]</span>
solidified into all kinds of fantastic forms, some sharply
pointed, some red, others black. On the east side of
the crater was a dome covered with earth with an underlying
flow of lava. Then could be observed a circular
group of huge rocks, pear-shaped, with sharp points
upward. While the volcano was active these rocks
had evidently stood on the rim of the then cylindrical
crater. The mountain behind those rocks was formed
by high accumulations of red volcanic sand, which in
time had gradually, by the action of rain and sun,
consolidated into soft rock.</p>

<p>The plateau extending northward, which was disclosed
in all its entirety before me from the elevation
of 1,600 ft. which we had reached, also seemed to
possess an extinct crater shaped like a crescent with
steep slopes and two rounded promontories on its
side.</p>

<p>The sky that day was partly covered by transparent
feathery clouds and by dense mist near the horizon
line to the east, but was quite clear to the west. As
usual, that evening we were again treated to fairly
handsome radiating white lines from the sun reaching
half way up the sky vault, but this time they were
flimsy and not to be compared to the magnificent displays
we had observed before.</p>

<p>Our animals still sank in ochre-coloured sand, or
stumbled on conglomerate rocks of spattered lava
pellets embedded in sandstone. Capping the higher
undulations we again found deposits of ashes.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-272.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-272_th.jpg" alt="Geometrical Pattern on the Surface of a flow of Lava." title="Geometrical Pattern on the Surface of a flow of Lava." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Geometrical Pattern on the Surface of a flow of Lava.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(Caused by sudden contraction in cooling.)</p>
<hr />
<p>We travelled for long distances on a ridge at an
elevation of 1,650 ft. over a thick layer of sand and
ashes mixed. Then campos spread before us, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-273" id="Pg_1-273"></a>[<a href="./images/1-273.png">273</a>]</span>
upon them here and there grew stunted vegetation,
the trees seldom reaching a greater height than 15 ft.</p>

<p>From our last high point of vantage the crater with
fantastic rocks and its continuation we had observed
appeared to form a great basin. A subsidiary vent was
also noticeable. Farther on our march we found other
immense deposits of grey ashes and sand alternately&mdash;one
great stretch particularly, at an elevation of
1,600 ft. Water at that spot filtered through from
underneath and rendered the slope a grassy meadow
of the most refreshing green. We were rising all the
time, first going north-west, then due north. At noon
we had reached the highest point.</p>

<p>From the high point on which we were (1,920 ft.)
we obtained a strange view to the west. Above the
straight line of the plateau before us rose in the distance
a pyramidal, steep-sided, sharply-pointed peak, standing
in solitary grandeur upon that elevated plain. Why
did it stand there alone? was the question one asked
oneself&mdash;a question one had to ask oneself frequently
as we proceeded farther and farther on our journey.
We often came upon mountains standing alone, either
on the top of table-lands or in the middle of extensive
plains. Their presence seemed at first unaccountable.</p>

<p>Again as we journeyed onward the mules' hoofs
were injured by treading over large expanses of lava
pellets and sharp-edged, cutting, baked fragments of
black rock, myriads of which also lay embedded in
reddish half-formed rock or buried in layers of yellowish-red
earth.</p>

<p>To the north was a majestic panorama of the most
delicate tones of blue and green, with almost over-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-274" id="Pg_1-274"></a>[<a href="./images/1-274.png">274</a>]</span>powering
sweeping lines hardly interrupted by a slight
indentation or a prominence rising above the sky-line.
Only to the north-west in the middle distance was
there the gentle undulating line of magnificent campos&mdash;most
regular in its curves, which spread in a
crescent toward the west. The line was interrupted
somewhat abruptly by a higher and irregular three-terraced
mass, but soon resumed its sweeping and
regularly curved undulations beyond. This great
crescent almost described a semicircle around the
smaller undulations over which we were travelling.</p>

<p>We descended to 1,750 ft. On facing west we had
curious scenery on our left (south). A huge basin had
sunk in&mdash;evidently by a sudden subsidence which had
left on its northern side high vertical cliffs supporting
the hill-range that remained standing. The undulating
centre and sides of the immense depression formed
beautiful campos with an occasional <i>bosquet</i> of forest
on the top of hills, and also on the lowest points of the
undulations. Those <i>bosquets</i> were few and far apart,
only to be found where moisture was plentiful. The
remains of a high, flat plateau, which had escaped while
the rest of the country had subsided, loomed alone in
the distance.</p>

<p>One of the central hills was crowned by great
black volcanic boulders of the same rock which
was visible at the southern edge of this great basin,
bounded by vertical cliffs&mdash;all of the same composition.</p>

<p>Directly south-west the evenness of the sky-line
was again interrupted by two mountains&mdash;flat-topped,
one not unlike the gabled roof of a house, the other like
a cylindrical tower on the top of a high conical hill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-275" id="Pg_1-275"></a>[<a href="./images/1-275.png">275</a>]</span>
We again rose to an elevation of 1,950 ft., still travelling
on the summit of the plateau bordering the deep depression.
We were compelled to describe a curve in our
route, and had reached a height of 2,000 ft. We perceived
to the north-east and east a long, uninterrupted&mdash;almost
flat&mdash;sky-line. We had described a sweeping
curve right round the irregular edge of the undulating
plateau. We could now look back upon the southern
aspect of the vertical black and brown rocky cliff, on
the summit of which we had been travelling. The
rocky cliffs were particularly precipitous and picturesque
in the western portion. Interminable campos were
still before us.</p>

<p>I occasionally picked up interesting plants and
flowers for my botanical collection. Innumerable in
this region were the plants with medicinal properties.
The <i>sentori</i> (<i>centaurea</i>) for instance&mdash;plentiful there,
with its sweetly pretty mauve flower&mdash;when boiled in
water gave a bitter decoction good for fever.</p>

<p>We came upon a patch of <i>landir</i> or <i>landirana</i> trees,
with luxuriant dark green foliage. They grew near
the water, and were by far the tallest and handsomest,
cleanest-looking trees I had so far seen in Matto Grosso.
They attained a great height, with extraordinarily dense
foliage, especially at the summit, but also lower down
at the sides. Then <i>burity</i> palms were fairly abundant
wherever one met <i>landir</i> trees in groups or tufts. We
were now travelling at an elevation of 2,050 ft., then
soon after at 2,100 ft. above the sea level. There was
merely stunted vegetation growing upon the red earth
and sand.</p>

<p>On descending from that high point we came upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-276" id="Pg_1-276"></a>[<a href="./images/1-276.png">276</a>]</span>
extraordinary scenery. To our right (north) was
another concave depression with a further subsidence
in its central part. Due west and north-west, from the
spot where we first observed the scene, appeared four
curious hemispherical domes forming a quadrangle
with three less important ones beyond. In the south-easterly
portion of the depression was a great rocky
mass, while due north another, and higher, conical
mount, much higher than all the others, could be
observed.</p>

<p>In the eastern part of the depression a wide circle
of big volcanic boulders&mdash;undoubtedly an extinct
crater&mdash;was to be seen, with huge masses of spattered
yellow lava in large blocks as well as ferruginous rock.
That great depression&mdash;taken in its entirety&mdash;was
subdivided into three distinct terraces, counting as
third the summit of the plateau. A mighty, deep,
impressive chasm, smothered in vegetation, could be
observed within the central crater&mdash;in the north-east
side of the circle.</p>

<p>The summit of the plateau, varying in elevation
from 2,000 ft. to 2,100 ft., on which we were travelling
was entirely covered by sand and grey ashes.</p>

<p>The valley in the depression extended in lovely
campos from south-west to north-east&mdash;in fact, as far
as the giant table-land which stood majestic in the
distance.</p>

<p>The scene, as we stood on the edge of the plateau,
was impressive in its grandeur, in its silence. In the
morning the sky was almost entirely covered with
transparent clouds in scales like a fish. In the afternoon
the sky above changed into horizontal layers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-277" id="Pg_1-277"></a>[<a href="./images/1-277.png">277</a>]</span>
globular clouds, which stood as still as death. Leaden
black globular accumulations covered one-third of the
sky vault, great unshapen masses overhead rendering
the air heavy.</p>

<p>We marched all that day on a deep layer of ashes.
On descending from the plateau we had on our left
great clean campos and plentiful <i>burity</i> palms in a
slight depression where moisture filtered through. As
the caravan was moving along gaily, a <i>veado</i> (deer)
gracefully leapt in front and, turning its head back
two or three times to look at us, ran before us. Filippe,
the negro, in his excitement, gave wild yells which set
the mules stampeding, while green parrots in couples,
scared at the sudden disturbance, flew overhead, adding
piercing shrieks to the rapid tinkling of the mules'
bells, the rattling of the baggage on the pack-saddles,
and the shouts of the men trying to stop the excited
mules. All those sudden noises mingled together were
quite a change for us, accustomed to a constant deathly
silence.</p>

<p>Before us on the W.N.W.&mdash;as we still sank in grey
ashes&mdash;were two conical hillocks. In the distance, to
the west, two small flat-topped plateaux rose above the
sky-line, and also two hills shaped not unlike the backs
of two whales. On our left we had an immense crack or
fissure extending from north-east to south-west between
the hill-range on which we travelled and another
on the south&mdash;both showing huge domes of eruptive
rock, apparently extensive flows of red lava subsequently
blackened on the surface by weathering. On the opposite
side to ours the rock was exposed all along the
fissure for a great height, except the surface padding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-278" id="Pg_1-278"></a>[<a href="./images/1-278.png">278</a>]</span>
on the summit, where beautiful fresh green grass was
in contrast to the deep tones of the rock. On our
side we were still struggling in ashes and sand, with
striated and much indented boulders of lava showing
through.</p>

<p>We found many <i>sicupira</i> nuts, of a small, flat and
fat oval shape, and a yellow-ochre colour. The shell
contained many tiny cells or chambers&mdash;just like the
section of a beehive. Each chamber was full of a bitter
oil, said to cure almost any complaint known.</p>

<p>On May 22nd I took observations with the hypsometrical
apparatus in order to obtain the correct elevation,
and also as a check to the several aneroids I was
using for differential altitudes. Water boiled at a
temperature of 210&deg; with a temperature of the atmosphere
of 70&deg; Fahr. This would make the elevation
at that spot 1,490 ft. above the sea level. The aneroids
registered 1,480 ft.</p>

<p>We came upon two strange rocks, one resembling
the head and neck of a much-eroded Sphinx&mdash;of natural
formation&mdash;blackened, knobby, and with deep grooves;
the other not unlike a giant mushroom. The sphinx-like
rock stood upon a pedestal also of rock in several
strata. The head was resting on a stratum 1 ft. thick,
of a brilliant red, and at a slight dip. Under it was
a white stratum much cracked, after which came a
stratum of white and red blending into each other.
This stratum, 2 ft. thick, showed the white more
diffused in the upper part than the lower. The lowest
stratum of all exposed was of a deep red.</p>

<p>Near this stood erect another columnar rock of a
similar shape, the head and base entirely of red rock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-279" id="Pg_1-279"></a>[<a href="./images/1-279.png">279</a>]</span>
It was eroded on the north-west side to such an extent
that it was almost concave in the lower part. This
rock, too, showed great cracks and a slight dip north-west
in the strata. Vertical fissures were noticeable,
and seemed caused by concussion.</p>

<p>A third rock&mdash;flat, with a convex bottom&mdash;stood as
if on a pivot on the angular point of a pyramidal larger
rock, this larger rock in its turn resting over a huge
base. There was no mistake as to how those two rocks
had got there. They had fallen from above, one on the
top of the other. A proof of this lay in the fact that
they had arrived with such force that the base had
split at the point of contact. As there was no hill
above or near those rocks, there was little doubt that
they had been flung there by volcanic action.</p>

<p>We were in a region of extraordinary interest and
surprises. In the plain which extended before us there
stood two conical hills in the far north-west, and
three other hills, dome-like, each isolated, but in a most
perfect alignment with the others, towards the east.
Close to us were giant domes of rock, the surface of
which formed marvellous geometrical designs of such
regularity that had they been on a smaller scale one
might have suspected them of being the work of human
beings; but they were not, as we shall see presently.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Salesian Fathers&mdash;A Volcanic Zone</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> arrived at the chief colony of the Salesians, Sagrado
Cora&ccedil;&atilde;o de Jesus (Tachos). There, thanks to the great
kindness and hospitality of the Fathers, and also owing
to the amount of interesting matter I found from a
geological and anthropological point of view, I decided
to halt for a day or two.</p>

<p>The Salesians had come to that spot, not by the way
I had gone, but by an easier way via Buenos Aires and
the Paraguay River, navigable as far as Cuyab&aacute;, the
capital of Matto Grosso. The friars had done wonderful
work in many parts of the State of Matto Grosso.
In fact, what little good in the way of civilization had
been done in that State had been done almost entirely
by those monks. They had established an excellent
college in Cuyab&aacute;, where all kinds of trades and professions
were taught. In the port of Corumb&aacute; a similar
school was established, and then there were the several
colonies among the Indians, such as the Sagrado
Cora&ccedil;&atilde;o de Jesus on the Rio Barreiro, the Immaculada
Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o on the Rio das Gar&ccedil;as, the Sangradouro
Colony, and the Palmeiras.</p>

<hr />
<p>As in this work I have limited myself to write on
things which have come directly under my observation,
I shall not have an opportunity of speaking of the work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-281" id="Pg_1-281"></a>[<a href="./images/1-281.png">281</a>]</span>
of the Salesians at Cuyab&aacute; or Corumb&aacute;&mdash;two cities I
did not visit&mdash;but I feel it my duty to say a few words
on the work of sacrifice, love and devotion performed
by the friars in those remote regions.</p>

<p>In the colony at Tachos, situated on a height, there
were several neat buildings for the friars and a village
for the Indians. What interested me most was to see
how much of the land around had been converted with
success to agricultural purposes. I inspected the buildings
where useful trades were taught to the Indians of
both sexes. Weaving-looms and spinning-wheels had
been imported at great expense and endless trouble, as
well as blacksmiths' and carpenters' tools of all kinds.
A delightfully neat garden with European flowers was
indeed a great joy to one's eyes, now unaccustomed
to so gay and tidy a sight. What pleased me most of
all was to notice how devoted to the Salesians the
Indians were, and how happy and well cared for they
seemed to be. They had the most humble reverence
for the Fathers.</p>

<p>Padre Antonio Colbacchini, the Father Superior, an
Italian, was an extremely intelligent and practical man,
one of the hardest workers I have ever met. With a
great love for science he had established a small observatory
on a high hill at a considerable distance from
the mission buildings. The abnegation with which
Father Clemente Dorozeski, in charge of the instruments,
would get up in the middle of the night and in all
weathers go and watch for the minimum temperature&mdash;their
instruments were primitive, and they did not
possess self-registering thermometers&mdash;was indeed more
than praiseworthy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-282" id="Pg_1-282"></a>[<a href="./images/1-282.png">282</a>]</span>
My readers can easily imagine my surprise when
one day Padre Colbacchini treated me, after dinner,
to an orchestral concert of such operas as <i>Il Trovatore</i>,
<i>A&iuml;da</i>, and the <i>Barbiere di Seviglia</i>, played on brass and
stringed instruments by Indian boys. The Bororos
showed great fondness for music, and readily learned to
play any tune without knowing a single note of music.
Naturally great patience was required on the part of
the teacher in order to obtain a collective melody which
would not seriously impair the drum of one's ear. The
result was truly marvellous. Brass instruments were
preferred by the Indians. The trombone was the most
loved of all. As the Indians all possessed powerful
lungs, they were well suited for wind instruments.</p>

<p>The colony was situated in one of the most
picturesque spots of Matto Grosso. When out for a
walk I came upon a great natural wall of rock with
immense spurs of lava, the surface of which was cut
up into regular geometrical patterns, squares and
lozenges. I think that in that particular case the
peculiarity was due to the lava having flowed over
curved surfaces. In coming in contact with the atmosphere
it had cooled more rapidly on the upper face
than the under, and in contracting quickly had split at
regular intervals, thus forming the geometrical pattern.</p>

<p>It was undoubted that we were there in the former
centre of inconceivable volcanic activity. In other
parts of a great dome of rock I came upon strange holes
in the rock&mdash;extremely common all over that region&mdash;which
might at first glance be mistaken for depressions
formed by glacial action, but which were not.
They were merely moulds of highly ferruginous rock,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-283" id="Pg_1-283"></a>[<a href="./images/1-283.png">283</a>]</span>
granular on its surface and not smoothed, as one would
expect in the walls of cavities made by the friction of
revolving ice and rock. Nor did I ever find at the
bottom of any of those pits, worn-down, smooth spherical
or spheroid rocks, such as are usually found in pits of
glacial formation. Those pits had been formed by
lava and molten iron flowing around easily crumbled
blocks of rock, or perhaps by large balls of erupted
mud which had dropped on molten lava, that had
then solidified round them, while the mud or soft rock
had subsequently been dissolved by rain, leaving the
mould intact. The latter theory would seem to me
the more plausible, as many of those pits showed much
indented, raised edges, as if splashing had taken place
when the rock now forming the mould was in semi-liquid
form. Only once or twice did I notice hollows with a
suggestion of spiral grooves in their walls; but I think
that those had been caused at a more recent date by
water flowing in and describing a spiral as it travelled
downward in the interior of the vessels.</p>

<p>On the hill where the observatory was situated two
circular volcanic vents were to be seen. The hill, which
had a slope on one side, had evidently been split, as on
reaching the top I found that an almost vertical precipice
was on the other side. Quantities of quartz and
crystals were to be found on that hill. All over that
region quaintly-shaped rocks were also to be found,
some like small cubic or rectangular boxes, others
not unlike inkstands, others in hollowed cylinders or
spheres. Many&mdash;and those were the quaintest of all&mdash;were
of a rectangular shape, which when split disclosed
a rectangular hollow inside. These natural boxes were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-284" id="Pg_1-284"></a>[<a href="./images/1-284.png">284</a>]</span>
mostly of iron rock, laminated, which had evidently
collected when in a liquid state round some soft matter,
that had subsequently evaporated or disappeared with
the intense heat, leaving empty spaces inside. The
laminations were about one-eighth of an inch thick.</p>

<p>Padre Colbacchini told me that some distance off
a curious pool of water existed which he called the
"electric spring." When you placed your hand in it
you received a slight electric shock, while a similar
impression to that of an electric current continued to
be felt as long as you kept your hand in the water.</p>

<p>The mission buildings at Tachos were at an elevation
of 1,600 ft., the observatory, 100 ft. higher.
The temperature on May 23rd was max. 81&deg;, min.
68&middot;4 Fahr. From the observatory hill an uncommon
sight was before us. Seven large and small isolated
conical and domed hills stood in perfect alignment
from N.N.E. to S.S.W. in two different sets.</p>

<p>In that region the prevalent wind was from the
E.S.E. during the months of May, June, July and
August. In September the wind veered gradually to
the north and north-east; whereas during the rainy
season winds from the north, north-west and south-east
were the most prevalent, especially the north-westerly
wind. When the wind came from the north it was
generally accompanied by heavy rain. The rainy
season in that particular zone of the immense Matto
Grosso state extended from October to the end of April.</p>

<p>The Rio Barreiros flowed in a northerly direction
(elev. 1,500 ft.) over a bed of red lava, ashes, red earth,
and sand. After leaving this river we quickly rose
again to an altitude of 1,700 ft. upon a first hill, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-285" id="Pg_1-285"></a>[<a href="./images/1-285.png">285</a>]</span>
to 1,800 ft. on a second, and 1,850 ft. on a third elevation
over a great spur of red lava, extending in a graceful
curve well into the valley below.</p>

<p>Exquisite was the view of the great plain below us,
with its magnificent campos stretching as far as the
eye could see, far away to the horizon line. In the far
distance, scattered here and there, rose the peculiar
flat-topped isolated mountains before described. Again
all that day we marched over ashes, red sand, and
volcanic d&eacute;bris. The highest point we reached was
1,950 ft. A snake dashed across our way among the
hoofs of my mule, but no harm was done.</p>

<p>Near Camp Bugueir&atilde;o (elev. 1,800 ft.), where we
halted, there was a delightful, clear, tiny spring emerging
from white volcanic crystallized rock. Then more
campos over lovely undulations in the country. Close
by was what the Brazilians call a <i>furnas</i> (from the
Latin <i>fornus</i>)&mdash;a somewhat misapplied term by which
they named any deep hollow or chasm, whether vertical
like a precipice or horizontal such as a cave.</p>

<p>It was getting slightly less cold during the nights.
On May 24th the Fahrenheit thermometer registered a
minimum of 60&deg; and a maximum temperature of 75&deg;.</p>

<p>Owing to the usual trouble of recovering the mules
in the morning we only left camp at 10.30 a.m., rising
over great masses of ferruginous rock, which showed
through the deposits of ashes and sand at an elevation
of 1,950 ft. The immense view of the campos in great
undulations was really exquisite to the west and south-west.</p>

<p>My mules were then travelling over a strange narrow
strip of rock at a height of 2,050 ft.&mdash;in some places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-286" id="Pg_1-286"></a>[<a href="./images/1-286.png">286</a>]</span>
only a few yards across&mdash;on the top of vertical walls
dividing two deep valleys, one to the south, very extensive,
with great lava-flows; another to the north.
In the latter valley an immense extinct crater was
visible, in three well-defined internal terraces and a
deep central depression.</p>

<p>Upon climbing on the summit of a high conical hill
I further discovered that the crater had an elongated
shape, the longest diameter being from north to south,
the southern and lower part being overlapped by a
voluminous flow of lava which also covered a great part
of the mountain slope. Strange monoliths were numerous,
among the many fantastically shaped rocks, and
also boulders lying about at all angles. One like a
huge table rested on the top of another, upon which
it had fallen with great force, as could be seen by
the vertical splitting of the rock underneath. The rock
above appeared simply broiled&mdash;and so were the huge
masses of d&eacute;bris, especially of ferruginous rock, which
had evidently been ejected by that crater. The entire
summit of the crater cone (2,100 ft. above the sea
level) was of hard black baked rock.</p>

<p>Close by, to the north, was another peculiar oval
depression, the highest part of which to the north-west
was in four distinct terraces in the interior. The
eastern part was more flattened, not unlike a huge soup
plate. In the centre was another deep depression&mdash;possibly
an extinct crater too. This second crater was
to the north of the high-domed crater described above.</p>

<p>In the near west we had mere undulations over
which we gradually travelled, but the country was
getting much more disturbed than it had appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-287" id="Pg_1-287"></a>[<a href="./images/1-287.png">287</a>]</span>
since leaving the Araguaya River. Due west farther
away stood before us a weird-looking plateau with a
vertical high wall to the north. To the south it showed
three terraces, the two lower ones supported on perpendicular
cliffs, whereas a convex slope was between
the second and third, or top terrace. To the south-west
in the far distance another high plateau could be perceived,
also with vertical cliffs to the north, but slanting
at its southern end&mdash;a shape characteristic of nearly all
the isolated mountains of that zone.</p>

<p>Looking south we perceived great tongues of lava
extending from east to west&mdash;the eastern point being
higher than the western, showing that the lava had
flowed there from east to west. Then there was also
a great sloping grassy slant, possibly over another extensive
lava-flow, from the crater we had examined.
Extending toward the south-west was another tongue
of lava of great width when measured from north-west
to south-east, the latter (south-east) being its
lowest point. On its north-east side this great flow
had a high vertical face. Between these enormous
tongues of lava, east to west and south-east to north-west,
was a depression or channel extending as far as
a distant high dome in three terraces to the south-west.
On our course we came upon more curious flattened
eruptive rocks, which had split on falling with great
force to earth after having been ejected from a volcano.</p>

<p>Other parallel ranges could be clearly perceived.
To bearings magnetic 160&deg; were again to be seen our old
friends the two strange gabled-roof and tower mountains.</p>

<p>I climbed up on the Pared&atilde;ozinho volcano (2,100 ft.
above the sea level) to examine its extinct crater,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-288" id="Pg_1-288"></a>[<a href="./images/1-288.png">288</a>]</span>
subdivided into two distinct large craters and a subsidiary
one.</p>

<p>One of these craters extended from east to west,
and had in one section on its rim a giant dome split
into quadrangular and lozenge-shaped sections, not
unlike magnified mosaic work. Next to it was a great
hill with a vertical natural wall overlooking the crater
itself. The horizontal strata of this natural wall, each
about a foot thick, looked exactly like a wonderful
masonry work, so perfectly straight were the strata,
and the square and rectangular rocks laid in lines with
such extraordinary regularity. This wall stood upon
solid masses of rock of immense size&mdash;hundreds of feet
in height.</p>

<p>The lip of the crater on the south side was just like
the well-laid pavement of a city, so regularly had the
lava cracked in contracting, thus leaving four- and
five-sided geometrical figures, all well fitting in with
their neighbours. Again, in this case, the lava, flowing
over a convex surface, had contracted on the surface
and caused the wonderful network of grooves. In
one section the crater had the appearance of an ancient
Roman or Etruscan amphitheatre with seats in many
tiers or steps, separated by vertical cracks&mdash;as if cut
out into separate blocks of stone.</p>

<p class="fsc">Volcanic Cavities (Matto Grosso).</p>
<hr />
<p>On the east side of the greatest portion of one
crater&mdash;which would seem to have been the most active
of all&mdash;I found again immense boulders with stratified
rock above them resembling masonry work, just the
same as and at the same elevation as the layers I had
examined in the larger elongated horseshoe crater. In
the centre of the smaller crater there flowed a rivulet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-289" id="Pg_1-289"></a>[<a href="./images/1-289.png">289</a>]</span>
of crystal-like water most delicious to drink. Undoubtedly
those eastern rocks were the lip of the crater,
for I discovered there two flows of lava in corrugations
and network designs such as we had observed on the
summit of the greater section. I had great difficulty
in climbing up the steep internal walls of the crater,
and on the steep slopes with dried grass, which was
slippery to a degree. On the top of the crater were
great masses of carbonated rock; also patches of
lapilli, and red and white sand, plentiful everywhere
in that zone.</p>

<p>The smaller crater&mdash;it seemed to me&mdash;must have
been a mere safety valve for the larger one. Its elevation,
it will be noticed, was the same as that of the latter.
From the summit of the one on which I was standing I
could perceive the other to the E.N.E., forming the
eastern boundary of this immense volcanic hollow.
The southern part of this great double crater was subdivided
into several sections, all in great rocky terraces&mdash;quite
vertical except in their lower portion, which
was sloping and had evidently been filled to a great
extent by an accumulation of ashes and erupted refuse.
On the side on which I stood, however, the crater had
not the diabolical, quite awe-inspiring, appearance of
the larger section of the huge volcanic mouth&mdash;quite
unscaleable by humans in its central section. In the
deep cracks in the rock were several small grottoes. I
experienced some difficulty and much fatigue in climbing
to the top (elev. 1,750 ft.) of the extinct volcano,
and especially in reaching the lip of the crater, owing
to the thick and much entangled scrub with innumerable
thorns.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-290" id="Pg_1-290"></a>[<a href="./images/1-290.png">290</a>]</span>
Our camp was at 1,500 ft., in a delightful spot at the
junction of two streams, one from the south descending
from the volcano, the other from the north. The two
rivers united flowed north&mdash;I think eventually into the
Rio das Mortes.</p>

<p>When we moved out of camp on May 25th (temperature,
minimum 62&deg;, maximum 80&deg; Fahr.) I noticed that,
after passing the wall-like section of the crater in the
northern aspect, there were strata with a dip south in
the inner part of the crater. The northern face of this
vertical wall showed thick strata cracked into squares
and rectangles with a dip in two different directions
at an angle. There a draining channel had formed.
Two rows of circular holes&mdash;like port-holes&mdash;were to
be seen, one directly under the summit, the other
one-third down the cliff side. A giant rectangular
tower of solid rock stood erect parallel to the great
wall. Skirting this vertical wall we travelled north-west-by-west,
rising gradually to 1,800 ft. on a deep
layer of red volcanic sand and grey ashes.</p>

<p>Looking back to the east we had a complete view of
the two-tiered plateaux with their vertical northern
walls, showing a dip south in their stratification. A
crowning mound could also be observed surpassing their
height, when we rose still higher to 1,900 ft. on the
summit of a ledge of cracked lava with a slant west-wards.
On the eastern side, where it had crumbled
owing to a subsidence, it showed a rounded moulding,
whereas on the other side were great waves of lava.
The lava had flowed from east to west.</p>

<p>After leaving this curious spot we went over undulating
red and ochre-coloured sand and more grey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-291" id="Pg_1-291"></a>[<a href="./images/1-291.png">291</a>]</span>
ashes. We rose twice to an elevation of 2,000 ft. We
crossed a streamlet of delicious water flowing north
over a red lava bed. Then more and more ashes
were found all along. A second stream&mdash;also flowing
north&mdash;was then negotiated, also over a red lava bed
(elev. 1,800 ft.), after which we climbed to 2,000 ft.,
descending soon after to 1,900 ft. on the banks of
another river flowing north-east.</p>

<p>At this spot were two more enormous lava-flows&mdash;one
on each side of the stream, and extending in a
tortuous course from south-west to north-east. The
lava had flowed north-east.</p>

<p>On rising slowly in deep red sand to an elevation
of 2,100 ft. we saw two prominent elevations of brilliant
red colouring to the south&mdash;they, too, with vertical
cliffs to the north. To the west loomed two huge
twin plateaux separated by an immense crack, also
with vertical walls to the north and a slight dip south
in the strata forming the various terraces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had reached a spot of most amazing scenery&mdash;the
Pared&atilde;o Grande&mdash;a giant hill mass displaying a great
crater in its north side. Two high cones stood
above the immense red-baked wall at its eastern end,
where it was in huge blocks stratified in thicknesses
varying from 15 to 20 ft. each. In that eastern section
the strata were perfectly horizontal. On the western
side of the crater was a colossal quadrangular mountain
of red-baked rock&mdash;a solid mass of granite with a
narrow band, slightly discoloured, all along its summit.
There&mdash;above&mdash;we also perceived a slight grassy slope,
and above it again a great natural wall in layers 6 ft.
thick. From the bottom of the mountain this upper
natural wall resembled the defences of a great castle
built on the summit of the giant rock. In approaching
this strange sight we had gone over extensive deposits
of ashes and yellow lava pellets and balls.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-292.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-292_th.jpg" alt="A Vertical Mass of Solid Rock of a Brilliant Red Colour." title="A Vertical Mass of Solid Rock of a Brilliant Red Colour." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">A Vertical Mass of Solid Rock of a Brilliant Red Colour.</p>
<hr />
<p>The elevation at the foot of this immense block
was 1,970 ft., the summit of the rock 660 ft. higher&mdash;so
that the reader can easily imagine how impressive
this quadrangular block of bright red rock was, several
hundred yards in length on each side and 201 metres
high.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-293" id="Pg_1-293"></a>[<a href="./images/1-293.png">293</a>]</span>
As we reached camp rather early I went to examine
the block from all sides. On the southern side Alcides
and I climbed up to within 30 ft. of the summit, and
from that high point obtained a stupendous panoramic
view of the great expanse of undulating country to the
south and south-east, while it was almost absolutely
flat to the west as far as the horizon line.</p>

<p>To the south-west were distinguishable some extraordinary-looking
cylindrical table-lands&mdash;like immense
sections of columns&mdash;rising well above the horizon line.
To the south in the distance a peculiar formation of
mountains could be seen&mdash;first a separate prismatic
mountain like a gabled roof with a well-defined vertical
high wall standing all along its longitudinal apex line.
Parallel to this and to one another were three sets of
mountains, with such steep sides that they seemed
like gigantic walls standing up on the flat country.
Behind them was a flat-topped plateau with a small
cone rising above it. The sides of the latter plateau
formed a steep escarpment. To the south-east was
a domed plateau, red in its lower section, green on the
top. Between this plateau and the last wall-like mountain,
several hundred feet in height, stood a conical
peak with a natural tower of rock upon it.</p>

<p>Beyond, to the south-east, could just be perceived two
pyramidal mountains, but they were very distant and
scarcely visible. The valley itself was greatly furrowed
in deep, long channels. Due south were dome-like
mounds&mdash;each of these, mind you, standing out individually
upon an almost flat plain.</p>

<p>In the north-western corners of the great quadrangular
Pared&atilde;o rock I saw a spot where it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-294" id="Pg_1-294"></a>[<a href="./images/1-294.png">294</a>]</span>
have been quite easy to climb up to the summit, as
portions of the rock had crumbled down and had left
an incline. But I had no object in making the ascent
on that side, especially as I had already obtained the
view I required from the south side. Also because I
was heavily laden, carrying cameras, aneroids, a large
prismatic compass, and three heavy bags of money
slung to the belt round my waist, and did not feel up
to the extra and useless exertion. Great arches with
a span of over 80 metres were to be seen in the lower
part of the western wall. To the south there was a
huge spur of lava with the geometrical pattern upon
its surface we had already observed elsewhere. In this
particular case, too, it appeared to me that the peculiar
net of surface channels had been formed in coming
in contact with the air, and not underground in the
boiling cauldron of the volcano when the ebullition of
the rock ceased. They were only found at a lower
elevation because they had gone down with a great
subsidence which had taken place, and in which
neither the quadrangular Pared&atilde;o Grande, nor the
peculiar isolated mountains we had observed from its
height, had been affected. They had remained standing
when all the rest sank for some six hundred feet and,
in places, more. That might perhaps account for the
extraordinary shapes of all those mountains, which
could not otherwise be explained.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-294.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-294_th.jpg" alt="The Pared&atilde;o Grande (Matto-Grosso)." title="The Pared&atilde;o Grande (Matto-Grosso)." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">The Pared&atilde;o Grande (Matto-Grosso).</p>
<hr />
<p>At the foot of the vertical giant block on the west
many domes of lava, channelled in a quadrangular network
pattern, and ridges and cones, were found, all
with a slope to the west. I had a great struggle in my
research work that day, owing to the thick scrub with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-295" id="Pg_1-295"></a>[<a href="./images/1-295.png">295</a>]</span>
vicious thorns that tore one's clothes and skin mercilessly.</p>

<p>We came upon an immense deep crack in the earth
surface&mdash;a regular ca&ntilde;on&mdash;which extended all along
the centre of the great valley. On the opposite side
of it were again big domes of lava in corrugated designs,
also a gigantic circular crater. Many natural crucibles
of iron rock, some cylindrical in shape, others oval,
others formed not unlike Pompeian lamps&mdash;while others
still were square or rectangular or lozenge-shaped&mdash;were
to be seen in many spots on the moraine-like
tails that extended southward, like the tentacles of an
octopus, and in the heaps of much carbonized rock and
solidified froth produced by what was once boiling rock.
The mounds of froth were usually collected in depressions.</p>

<p>The west side of the Pared&atilde;o was decidedly the
most interesting of all. Its great arches showed that
it must have once formed the sides of a great cauldron&mdash;the
top of which had subsequently collapsed or been
blown off. This seemed quite apparent from the discoloration
in the rocky cliff some 50 ft. above the
arches, which followed the exact line of what must
have been the thickness of the vault. The rock in
that discoloured section was perfectly smooth, whereas
above that it became much cracked vertically in layers,
and gave the appearance of a masonry wall.</p>

<p>Toward the south-western corner there was a
prismatic tower. Where the peculiar isolated rocks
near the tower formed a spur, a dip was noticeable in
the flow of the once molten rock, following what must
have been at that time the surface soil over the cauldron's
roof.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-296" id="Pg_1-296"></a>[<a href="./images/1-296.png">296</a>]</span>
A huge triangular crater could be seen, from which
started an enormous crack of great length in the lava-flow
of the valley to the west.</p>

<p>The southern face of that stupendous rocky quadrangle
was not quite so vertical as the west and north
sides, and was more in tiers or steps of lava&mdash;but very
steep indeed. It had in its lower part a great spur
extending southward.</p>

<p>As I have said, Alcides and I arrived within 30 ft.
of the summit of the great Pared&atilde;o, at an elevation of
2,550 ft., the summit being 2,580 ft.; but owing to the
last 30 ft. being absolutely vertical and the top rock
of a crumbling nature, and as my object in wishing to
obtain a full view of the country to the south had
been attained, I did not think it worth while to court
an accident for nothing. It was well after sunset when
we were up there, and it would take a long time to
return to camp. So we hastened on our return journey.</p>

<p>The sunset that night&mdash;which we watched from
that high point of vantage&mdash;was really too stupendous
for words, and not unlike an aurora borealis&mdash;red, gold
and violet lines radiating from the sun like a gorgeous
fan and expanding as they approached the summit of
the sky vault. The descent was more difficult than the
ascent, owing to the slippery nature of the rock.</p>

<p>At night, while back in camp, we saw to the W.N.W.,
quite low on the horizon, a brilliant planet&mdash;possibly
Venus. The stars and planets appeared always wonderfully
bright and extraordinarily large on fine nights.
Whether it was an optical illusion or not I do not
know, but the phenomenon, which lasted some hours,
was seen by all my men, and appeared also when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-297" id="Pg_1-297"></a>[<a href="./images/1-297.png">297</a>]</span>
planet was seen through a powerful hand telescope.
It seemed to discharge powerful intermittent flashes,
red and greenish, only toward the earth. Those flashes
were similar to and more luminous than the tail of a
small comet, and of course much shorter&mdash;perhaps
four to five times the diameter of the planet in their
entire length.</p>

<p>Whether this phenomenon was due to an actual
astral disturbance, or to light-signalling to the earth
or other planet, it would be difficult&mdash;in fact, impossible&mdash;to
ascertain with the means I had at my command.
Perhaps it was only an optical illusion caused by
refraction and deflected rays of vision, owing to the
effect upon the atmosphere of the heated rocky mass
by our side and under us&mdash;such as is the case in effects
of mirage. I am not prepared to express an opinion,
and only state what my men and I saw, merely suggesting
what seem to me the most plausible explanations.</p>

<p>At moments the planet seemed perfectly spherical,
with a marvellously definite outline, and then the
flashes were shot out especially to the right as one
looked at the planet, and downward slightly at an
angle, not quite perpendicularly.</p>

<p>That night, May 25th-26th, was cold: min. 58&deg;
Fahr. But during the day at 9 a.m. the thermometer
already registered 85&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>The sky, half covered by flimsy transparent mist to
the east, and by globular thin clouds, large overhead and
of smaller dimensions to the west, developed later in the
day into a charming mackerel sky, with two great
arches of mist to the south, and delicate horizontal
layers of mist near the earth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-298" id="Pg_1-298"></a>[<a href="./images/1-298.png">298</a>]</span>
It was only when we were some distance off that
we obtained a full and glorious view of the western side
of the Pared&atilde;o. The upper stratum showed a slight
dip north, then there was a ledge on which grass seemed
to flourish, and below it two parallel strata in a wavy
line from north to south. Those two strata could be
traced again&mdash;after a dip&mdash;in the range with two cones,
separated as we have seen by a deep gap from the
great wall-cliffs of the Pared&atilde;o. The indication of what
must have been once an enormous dome over a huge
cavity or cauldron could be noticed in the western cliff,
and also numerous chambers, large and small&mdash;at
least, judging by the arches in great numbers noticeable
in the wall. In other words, you had there the same
effect as the one often seen in cities when houses are
pulled down and the remains of the various rooms are
visible on the remaining side walls.</p>

<p>Looking north as we left the disturbed region of the
Pared&atilde;o Grande, we came upon a great valley, with a
depression in its centre. We were still travelling on
volcanic ochre-coloured sand in deep layers, especially
as we rose to an altitude of 2,350 ft., overlooking a huge
basin. We had then a good general view of the southern
aspect of the Pared&atilde;o Grande. In its side a huge gap
with vertical walls&mdash;a vent perhaps&mdash;could be noticed,
reaching as far as the summit of the mountain. It was
interesting to note that all the great cracks in the
earth's crust found in that region almost invariably
had a direction from north to south, so that the ranges
which remained bordering them must have split in a
lateral movement east and west.</p>

<p>Six kilometres from camp through the forest we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-299" id="Pg_1-299"></a>[<a href="./images/1-299.png">299</a>]</span>
came upon some singularly delicious green, smooth
grassy slopes. In other places were perfectly circular
or oval concave basins of volcanic ashes, in the centre
of which stood charming groups of <i>burity</i> palms and
trees with most luxuriant foliage. These <i>bosquets</i> existed
in the hollow of all the basins where profuse
infiltrations of moisture caused the luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<p>We were at an elevation of 2,350 ft. On going
down to a stream (elev. 2,130 ft.) we encountered great
flows of lava. It had flowed in a westerly direction.
We were proceeding through enchanting vegetation
when we came to a second and a third <i>cuvette</i> or basin
adorned with plentiful healthy palms in its central
point.</p>

<p>As I was admiring the curious sight of these clusters
of high vegetation absolutely surrounded by a wide
band of lawn&mdash;such as one would see in a well-kept
English park&mdash;a heavy and sudden storm arrived, which
in a few seconds drenched us to the marrow of our
bones. I have seldom seen or felt drops of water of
such weight and size as when the rain began, followed
within a few seconds by a downpour in bucketfuls.</p>

<p>Animals, baggage, and men, dripping all over, went
along, rising to 2,400 ft. above the sea level, by the side
of a conical hill. A huge block of volcanic rock&mdash;shot
and deposited there evidently from elsewhere&mdash;was to
be seen near by.</p>

<p>Eighteen kilometres from our last camp we descended
to a streamlet, dividing a grassy basin like the
preceding ones. Again I noticed here that all divisions
between ranges&mdash;caused by volcanic or other violent
action, and not by erosion&mdash;were in a direction from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-300" id="Pg_1-300"></a>[<a href="./images/1-300.png">300</a>]</span>
north to south. We had this in the Pared&atilde;o Grande,
and in the triple division of the top-dyked mountains on
the south, and also in the gabled and tower mountains
we had observed for some days to the south-west.</p>

<p>Again during the night I saw to the west the phenomenon
of the previous evening repeated&mdash;the strange
flashes directly under and occasionally to the left of
the brilliant planet&mdash;that is to say to the right of the
person observing it.</p>

<p>This was from Camp Areal, where we suffered terribly
during the day from our friends the <i>pium</i>, which filled
our eyes and ears and stung us all over; and at sunset
from the <i>polvora</i> or <i>polvorinha</i> (or powder), so called
because of their infinitesimal size&mdash;most persistent
mosquitoes, so greedy that they preferred to be squashed
rather than escape when they were sucking our blood
on our hands and faces. Fortunately, during the
night&mdash;with the cold (min. Fahr. 56&deg;)&mdash;we had a little
respite, and these brutes disappeared, only to return
to their attack at sunrise with the warmth of the sun.
At 9 a.m. the thermometer already registered a temperature
of 95&deg; Fahr. in the sun&mdash;a jump of 39&deg;, which,
notwithstanding mosquitoes and <i>pium</i>, my men greatly
enjoyed.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-300.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-300_th.jpg" alt="The Pared&atilde;o Grande, showing Vertical Rocks with Great Arches." title="The Pared&atilde;o Grande, showing Vertical Rocks with Great Arches." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">The Pared&atilde;o Grande, showing Vertical Rocks with Great Arches.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have never seen men suffer more from the cold
than my followers. They were simply paralyzed and
frozen at that comparatively high temperature. They
moaned and groaned and wept all night, although they
slept in their clothes and were tightly wrapped up in
heavy blankets. Moreover, they had spread a heavy
waterproof double tent over the lot of them, as they
lay closely packed to one another, covering heads and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-301" id="Pg_1-301"></a>[<a href="./images/1-301.png">301</a>]</span>
all, and had arranged a blazing fire enough to roast an
ox quite close to them.</p>

<p>Personally, I was quite happy under a mere shelter
tent&mdash;open for precaution on all sides, owing to preceding
experiences, so that I could see what was going
on all around without getting up from my camp bed.
I only had a mere thin camel-hair blanket over me. I
never slept in my clothes, preferring the comfort of
ample silk pyjamas. In the morning I always indulged
in my cold shower bath, two large buckets of water
being poured by Alcides upon my head and back,
amid the shivering yells of my trembling companions,
who, at a distance, watched the operation, wrapped
up to such an extent that merely their eyes were
exposed.</p>

<p>"He is mad!" I often heard them murmur with
chattering teeth.</p>

<p>Beneath heavy horizontal clouds low in the sky and
ball-like cloudlets above, we started off once more
from an elevation of 2,100 ft. at the camp to proceed
over a plateau 2,300 ft. high and some 6 kil. broad from
east to west. Then we descended into another charming
<i>cuvette</i> (elev. 2,100 ft.), and farther on to a streamlet
flowing north, the Rio Coriseo.</p>

<p>We were then travelling over reddish and ochre-coloured
volcanic sand, going through stunted and
fairly open <i>matto</i> (forest), higher up at 2,250 ft. in
successive undulations crossing our route at right
angles. In one of the depressions (elev. 2,150 ft.) was
a river&mdash;the Rio Torresino&mdash;flowing north. Quantities
of yellow globular lava pellets and lumpy blocks&mdash;evidently
ejected by a volcano&mdash;were seen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-302" id="Pg_1-302"></a>[<a href="./images/1-302.png">302</a>]</span>
The stream Cabe&ccedil;a de Boi&mdash;forming after the Rio
Macacos (or River of Monkeys) a tributary of the Rio
das Mortes, into which flowed all the rivulets we had
lately met&mdash;was next crossed (elev. 2,130 ft.). Over
more and deep beds of ashes we journeyed at 2,270 ft.
on the southern edge of a great grassy basin extending
from east to west. Again a delightful group of palms
and healthy trees was in the typical depression. Ant-hills
were innumerable on all sides. One could not
help admiring their architectural lines, which formed all
kinds of miniature fortresses and castles. We were
worried to death by the <i>pium</i> or <i>lambe-olhos</i> (eye-lickers),
as the Brazilians call them, which followed us
all day in swarms around our heads and hands, entering
our mouths, noses, eyes and ears. Only for a few
moments, when there blew a gust of wind, were we freed
from this pest, but they soon returned to their attack
with renewed vigour.</p>

<p>We rose again to an altitude of 2,380 ft. on another
great dome of red lava, which had flowed northwards,
as could be plainly seen as we ascended on its rounded
back. Upon it were quantities of crystals and yellow
lava pellets and pebbles and carbonated rock, resting
on whitish and grey ashes. On the summit, where
fully exposed, numerous perforations, cracks and striations
were visible in the flow, we were able to observe
plainly how the lava in a liquid state had flowed and
quickly cooled while other strata of liquid lava flowed
over it, one overlapping another like the scales of a
fish, and forming so many oval or ovoid bosses with
channels between.</p>

<p>From that high point we had a perfectly level sky-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-303" id="Pg_1-303"></a>[<a href="./images/1-303.png">303</a>]</span>line
all around us, except for the Pared&atilde;o Grande and
the Pared&atilde;ozinho, then to the E.N.E. of us.</p>

<p>At an elevation of 2,520 ft. we perceived that day
to the E.S.E. a double-towered massive rocky mountain
of a brilliant red colour, reminding one of the shape of
an Egyptian temple, and a lower hill range in undulations
behind it to the south, projecting at its sides.</p>

<p>We were marching on the northern edge of deep
and extensive depressions to the south and south-east
of us. Domed undulations in progressive steps from
north to south were noticeable in the southern portion
of the landscape, and from south to north in the northern
and much-wooded zone.</p>

<p>When we were at an elevation of 2,550 ft. we had
still red and yellow sand and ashes with stunted and
sparse vegetation. Upon descending we skirted the
southern side of another peculiar oval basin&mdash;this
time one which possessed a thin strip or row of tall
vegetation in perfect alignment in the central line of
depression. A deep deposit of grey ashes and sand
encircled this <i>cuvette</i>. The general longitudinal direction
of the oval was from the south, the highest point,
to the north, the lowest of the rim.</p>

<p>Having travelled 28 kil. from Areal we made camp
on a streamlet flowing north.</p>

<p>The company of my men was a great trial to me&mdash;a
penance I had to bear in silence. What was more, I
could not let it appear in the slightest degree that it
was a penance to me, if I did not wish to make matters
worse. Pusillanimity and fear are two qualities which
I cannot quite understand nor admit in men. Hence,
it is well to be imagined what I suffered in being with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-304" id="Pg_1-304"></a>[<a href="./images/1-304.png">304</a>]</span>
followers who, with the exception of Alcides and Filippe
the negro, were afraid of everything.</p>

<p>One of the men had a toothache. His last tooth
in the lower jaw was so badly decayed that merely
the outside shell remained. No doubt it gave him
great pain. I offered to remove it for him&mdash;without
a guarantee of painless extraction. The fear of greater
pain than he endured&mdash;even for a few minutes&mdash;was
too much for him. He would not hear of parting with
what remained of the tooth. Result: for twelve consecutive
days and nights that fellow cried and moaned
incessantly&mdash;holding his jaw with both hands while
riding a quiet mule, and sobbing <i>hai, hai, hai, hai!</i> all
day long at each step of the animal&mdash;with variations
of <i>hoi, hoi, hoi, hoi</i>, when the mule went a little quicker,
and significant loud shrieks of <i>uppepp&eacute;, uppepp&eacute;,
uppepp&eacute;</i> when the animal began to trot, giving the rider
an extra pang. That intense pain invariably stopped
at meal-times, and it did not seem to have an appreciable
effect on the man's ravenous appetite. My men
never let a chance go by to let their companions share
to the fullest extent in their sufferings. They had no
consideration whatever for other people's feelings. In
all the months they were with me they never once
showed the slightest trace of thoughtfulness towards
me, or indeed even towards any of their comrades.</p>

<p>Mean to an incredible degree in their nature&mdash;and
I am certain no one could have been more generous
than I was to them in every possible way&mdash;they believed
that no matter what I did was due to wishing to save
money. If I would not allow them to blaze away dozens
of cartridges at a rock or a lizard&mdash;cartridges were a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-305" id="Pg_1-305"></a>[<a href="./images/1-305.png">305</a>]</span>
most expensive luxury in Central Brazil, and, what was
more, could not be replaced&mdash;it was because I wished to
economize. If one day I ate a smaller tin of sardines
because I was not so hungry, remarks flew freely about
that I was a miser; if I did not pitch a tent because I
preferred, for many reasons, sleeping out in the open
on fine nights, it was, according to them, because I
wished to spare the tent to sell it again at a higher
price when I returned home! They discussed these
things in a high voice and in a most offensive way,
making my hands itch on many occasions and my
blood boil. But I had made up my mind that I would
never lose my temper with them, nor my calm; and
I never did, trying as it was to keep my promise.</p>

<p>With all this meanness of which they were accusing
me, these poltroons were clothed in garments such as
they had never before possessed in their lives; they
were gorging themselves with food such as they had
never dreamt of having in their homes, where they had
lived like pariah dogs&mdash;and huge heaps were thrown
daily to the dogs&mdash;and they were paid a salary five
times higher than they could have possibly earned
under Brazilian employers.</p>

<p>What annoyed me a great deal with these men was
the really criminal way in which they&mdash;notwithstanding
my instructions&mdash;always tried to smash my
cameras and scientific instruments and to injure anything
I possessed. Those men were vandals by nature.
The more valuable an object was, the greater the
pleasure they seemed to take in damaging it.</p>

<p>Thus another and unnecessary burden was placed
upon me in order to save my instruments from destruc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-306" id="Pg_1-306"></a>[<a href="./images/1-306.png">306</a>]</span>tion,
not only from natural accidents but through the
infamy of my followers. Those fellows seemed to take
no pride in anything. Even the beautiful and expensive
repeating rifles and automatic pistols I had given
each man had been reduced to scrap-iron. Yet they
were so scared of Indians that the first time we met
some, they handed over to them anything that took
their fancy&mdash;and which belonged to me, of course&mdash;for
fear of incurring their ill-favour. During my absence
from camp they even gave away to the Indians a
handsome dog I had, which I never was able to trace
again.</p>

<p>Like all people with a dastardly nature, they could
on no account speak the truth&mdash;even when it would
have been to their advantage. They could never
look you straight in the face. Hence, full of distrust
for everybody, all the responsibility of every kind
of work in connection with the expedition fell upon
me. I not only had to do my own scientific work,
but had to supervise in its minutest detail all the work
done by them, and all the time. It was indeed like
travelling with a band of mischievous demented people.
The mental strain was considerable for me.</p>

<p>On that day's march we had passed two crosses
erected, the Salesians had told me, on the spot where
two men had been murdered by passing Brazilians&mdash;not
by Indians. Their usual way of procedure was
to shoot people in the back&mdash;never in front&mdash;or else
when you were asleep. Nearly all carried a razor on
their person&mdash;not to shave with, but in order to cut
people's throats as a vengeance, or even under less
provocation. This was usually done in a quick way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-307" id="Pg_1-307"></a>[<a href="./images/1-307.png">307</a>]</span>
by severing the artery at the neck while the person
to be killed was asleep.</p>

<p>The Brazilians of the interior were almost altogether
the descendants of criminal Portuguese, who had been
exiled to the country, and intermarried with the lowest
possible class of African slaves. They seemed to feel
strongly their inferiority when facing a European,
and imagined&mdash;in which they were not far wrong&mdash;the
contempt with which, although it was covered by
the greatest politeness, one looked down upon them.
That was perhaps the only excuse one could offer for
their vile behaviour, which, according to their low
mental qualities, they liked to display in order to prove
their independence and superiority.</p>

<p>We made our camp in a heavenly spot&mdash;barring the
devilish <i>borrachudo</i> (mosquitoes)&mdash;on the bank of a
crystal-like streamlet flowing north (elev. 2,200 ft.).
We were really fortunate to have excellent and plentiful
water all the time. The thermometer went down during
the night to a minimum of 54&deg; Fahr. There were more
shivers and moans from my men. Only Alcides and
Filippe behaved in a manly way. The others were in
terror of attacks from the <i>on&ccedil;a pintada</i> (<i>felis on&ccedil;a</i>) or
spotted jaguar of Brazil, and of the <i>terrivel tamanduas
bandeira</i>, a toothless pachyderm, with a long and hairy
tail, long nails, and powerful arms, the embrace of
which is said to be sufficient to kill a man, or even
a jaguar, so foolish as to endeavour wrestling with
it. It had a long protruding nose or proboscis, which
it inserted into ant-heaps. A tongue of abnormal
length was further pushed out, and then quickly withdrawn
when crammed with attacking ants. Ants were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-308" id="Pg_1-308"></a>[<a href="./images/1-308.png">308</a>]</span>
its favourite food. Although my men talked all the
time of the terrible <i>bandeiras</i>, we never had the good
fortune to receive the fond embraces of one.</p>

<p>We had a beautiful sky&mdash;perfectly clear&mdash;on May
28th, except perhaps a faint curtain of mist near
the horizon to the west. Two of my horses had unfortunately
strayed; and as the men searched the <i>matto</i>
with trembling knees in fear of meeting a <i>bandeira</i>
instead of the missing horses, they were not recovered
until late in the afternoon, so that we did not depart
until 4 p.m.</p>

<p>We went up to the top of an undulation (elev.
2,400 ft.), on grey ashes as usual in the lower part of
the hill, and red volcanic sand on the summit. That
afternoon's journey was not unlike tobogganing up and
down all the time&mdash;at elevations varying from 2,500
to 2,350 ft.&mdash;over domes of sand, ashes, and eruptive
rock, and dykes with depressions, some 100 ft. deep
or so, and all extending from north to south.</p>

<p>We saw some gorgeous red <i>araras</i> or macaws of
giant size. They were a beautiful sight as they flew,
with their hoarse shrieks, above our heads.</p>

<p>At sunset we were travelling along the north edge
of a great grassy depression wooded in its central pit&mdash;the
line of depression and of the central vegetation
being from north to south.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-308a.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-308a_th.jpg" alt="Mushroom-shaped Rocks of Volcanic Formation." title="Mushroom-shaped Rocks of Volcanic Formation." /></a></p>

<p class="fsc">A Great Earthquake Fissure in the Terrestrial Crust (Matto Grosso).</p>
<hr />
<p>We were treated to a glorious sunset. The entire
sky had become of a deep violet colour and Indian red,
relieved here and there by golden tints, with blue
cloudlets of wonderful regularity in a line. Curiously
enough, the most brilliant colouring was to the east
and not to the west, as would have been expected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-309" id="Pg_1-309"></a>[<a href="./images/1-309.png">309</a>]</span>
Eventually the entire sky became of a glorious yellow,
like a golden cupola&mdash;blending into a lovely emerald
green in its highest point overhead.</p>

<p>Again we found ourselves on another large dome of
eruptive rock, in some places reduced into fine tobacco-coloured
powder, getting somewhat darker in colour
where the under stratum was of sand and soft conglomerate
easily crumbled under pressure, and containing
pellets of black ferruginous rock and grains of iron.
Large blocks of iron rock were exposed to the air in
many places.</p>

<p>We arrived at the third Salesian colony of St. Jos&eacute;
or Sangrador, near which was a small settlement of
Brazilians&mdash;a bad lot indeed. One of my best horses
was stolen here, and I was never able to recover it.
I remained in that unpleasant place for three days,
endeavouring to recover the animal, but it was of no
avail.</p>

<p>The Salesians had a handsome property, the agricultural
resources of which they were fast developing.
Sugar-cane, mandioca, rice, beans, and Indian corn
were raised with success. Father Antonio Malan,
Inspector-General of the Salesians, arrived from the
west, via Cuyab&aacute;. He was an extremely intelligent
and enterprising man&mdash;who should be congratulated on
selecting such excellent sites for the various colonies,
as well as for the sensible, businesslike fashion in
which the colonies were conducted. They were indeed
the only few bright spots where the light of civilization
shone in those sadly abandoned regions.</p>

<p>Here are the meagre entries in my diary for the
two following days:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-310" id="Pg_1-310"></a>[<a href="./images/1-310.png">310</a>]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>May 29th. Remained at Sangrador in search of
missing horse. Temperature: min. 54&deg;; max. 83&deg;
Fahr. Perfectly clear sky.</p>

<p>May 30th. Obliged to remain one more day at
Sangrador. Horse missing still. All men have gone
searching the forest for it. Temperature: min. 56&frac12;&deg;
Fahr; max. 75&deg; Fahr. Elevation 2,050 ft.</p>

<p>It was indeed a great treat to be able to converse
with so intelligent a gentleman as Father Malan after
the company I had been in since leaving Goyaz.</p>

<p>Father Malan was a man with a heart of gold and
great courage. Under him the Salesians will some day
continue their good work and spread happiness and
culture among the few Indians who now remain in
Matto Grosso. What had already been done by the
Salesians was amazing. No doubt, with their great
enterprise, they would certainly continue their good
work of civilization and science combined.</p>

<p>Although the Salesians tried hard to induce men to
accompany my expedition, their efforts were rewarded
with no success; so that I had to be content with the
handful of men I had with me. I foresaw disaster
from that moment, for thirty was the least number of
men I needed to carry out my work properly&mdash;and
thirty good men at that. Instead, I only had six men,
two of them extraordinarily plucky but quite uncontrollable;
the others absolutely worthless.</p>

<p>Had I been a wise man I should have turned back.
But I am not a wise man, and I never turn back; so
that there only remained one thing to do&mdash;go on as
best I could, come what might.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> May 31st (thermometer min. 56&deg;, max. 74&deg; Fahr.)
I decided to abandon the missing horse and proceed on
my journey. I suspected, with reason, that the animal
had been stolen. It was no use wasting any more time
searching for it. We thus bade good-bye for good to
the Salesians, and left the great basin of the Sangrador
River (elev. 2,050 ft.).</p>

<p>We travelled over sparsely wooded country to
2,350 ft. Tobacco-coloured soil was still under our feet,
yellow spattered lava, then again reddish soil, wonderfully
rich and fertile, if only it could be cultivated.
The country was here peculiar for its many undulations
until we arrived on the rim of a large basin, extending
from north-west to south-east, of great campos, with
stunted vegetation at first, but later with a truly
luxuriant growth of vigorous-looking <i>Jtauba preta</i>
(<i>Oreodaphne Hookeriana</i> Meissn.), with thick deep green
foliage.</p>

<p>We crossed two streamlets flowing north. On going
uphill we travelled on masses of volcanic pellets (elev.
2,500 ft.). To the south we could see a number of hills,
the sides of which showed the great effects of erosion
by wind and water. Nearly all those hill ranges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-312" id="Pg_1-312"></a>[<a href="./images/1-312.png">312</a>]</span>
extended from east to west. A long depression could
be observed cutting them from north to south.</p>

<p>That was a fine day for cloud effects, especially along
the horizon, where they displayed horizontal lines,
while they had great ball-like tops. Higher up, to
the north-west, was feathery mist turning the sky to
a delicate pale blue. A heavy, immense stratum of
cloud in four perfectly parallel terraces extended on
the arc from west to north.</p>

<p>We descended into a <i>cuvette</i> with the usual cluster
of vegetation in the centre and campos around. To
the south-west of that <i>cuvette</i> was an elongated but
well-rounded mountain, extending from east to west,
and beyond, to the S.S.W., in the far distance, an
almost identical replica of it. We travelled on deep
volcanic sand on the west slope of the <i>cuvette</i> and in
deep ashes at the bottom until we arrived at the Sangradorzinho
River, flowing north.</p>

<p>June 1st (thermometer min. 55&frac12;&deg; Fahr.; max. 74&deg;;
elev. 2,150 ft.). Heavy mist and rain-clouds, heavy
and sultry atmosphere. Sky almost entirely covered
by clouds.</p>

<p>Owing to trouble among my followers and waiting
for one of my men, who had remained behind in a last
effort to find the missing horse, we were unable to
leave camp until nearly noon. We rose to an elevation
of 2,400 ft., leaving behind the great <i>cuvette</i>, and marching
over parallel domes extending from north to south.
Between those domes in the depressions were sandy
<i>cuvettes</i> of verdant grass and the usual central <i>bosquets</i>.</p>

<p>Cinders and sand were still plentiful, with stunted,
thin trees growing upon them. Several times that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-313" id="Pg_1-313"></a>[<a href="./images/1-313.png">313</a>]</span>
day we reached an elevation of 2,550 ft. After passing
a streamlet flowing north, we kept at that elevation for
a considerable distance, after which, having descended
100 ft. (2,450 ft.), we found ourselves in a most enchanting,
oval-shaped <i>cuvette</i> of cinders well covered with
fresh verdure, and in its centre from north to south a
row of <i>burity</i> palms.</p>

<p>That was indeed a day of great surprises in the way
of scenery. No sooner had we left that beautiful
<i>cuvette</i> than we came to a magnificent flat open valley
extending from E.S.E. to W.N.W. In its northern
part, where a pool of stagnant water was to be found,
were innumerable <i>burity</i> palms. It was evident that
during the rainy season that plain (elev. 2,350 ft.)
must be entirely under water. In many places it was
swampy, even at the time of my visit. It was most
refreshing to the eyes to see such expanses of lovely
green healthy grass. The mules and horses enjoyed
it more than we did, neighing to their hearts' content
when we emerged into the great verdant meadow.
They tore away with their teeth at the delicious grass
as they cantered along gaily.</p>

<p>Some of the enjoyment of the delightful scenery
was taken away from me&mdash;not only that day, but
every day during almost an entire year&mdash;owing to the
stupid obstinacy of my men. They carried their
magazine rifles fully loaded&mdash;eight cartridges in each&mdash;and
while marching insisted on keeping the rifles
cocked; they would not hear of keeping them at
safety&mdash;so that any extra jerk or a twig of a tree catching
the trigger might cause the weapons to go off at
any moment. This would have mattered little if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-314" id="Pg_1-314"></a>[<a href="./images/1-314.png">314</a>]</span>
had slung their rifles in the usual way, pointing skyward
or else towards the earth. But no-one could
never induce a Brazilian to do things in a sensible way.
No, indeed; they must carry their rifles horizontally
upon the shoulder, the muzzles of the nearest weapons
always pointing at me. It was no use remonstrating,
as they might perhaps have misunderstood it as
fear. So all I could do was to trust in Providence. I
could not have done better, for Providence indeed
watched over me and protected me on that expedition
in a most merciful way&mdash;for which I am truly grateful.
On several occasions&mdash;as was to be expected from the
careless way in which the weapons were carried&mdash;now
one rifle then another went off unexpectedly, and I
came mighty near being shot. On other occasions the
mules had narrow escapes. Once a bullet went right
through the hat of one of my men, just missing his head.</p>

<p>In any case, I beg the reader to realize how pleasant
it was to have the muzzle of a loaded rifle, ready to be
fired, pointing at you in front for an average of eight
to twelve hours a day for several months. I generally
rode last in the caravan in order to prevent straggling,
and also to see that any baggage which fell off the
pack-saddles was recovered. This was unpleasant in
more ways than one. First the clouds of dust raised by
the animals as we marched over the sand and cinders,
which filled my eyes, mouth and nose; then the constant
attention to watch for lost baggage&mdash;besides the work
of writing my notes as we rode along. The sound of
the dangling bells of the mules was monotonous to a
degree, and so was the aspect of the animals' tails
swinging and slashing from one side to the other in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-315" id="Pg_1-315"></a>[<a href="./images/1-315.png">315</a>]</span>
order to drive away tormenting flies. Occasionally,
when stung fiercely by a horse-fly, one or two animals
would dash away wildly, tearing off in their career low
branches of trees and even altogether knocking down
good-sized trees, four or five inches in diameter.</p>

<p>This would seem impossible in any other country,
but not in Brazil, where the majority of the trees were
nearly entirely eaten up inside by ants. The roots,
owing to the substratum of lava spread horizontally
near the surface, offered little resistance to side pressure
upon the tree itself, so that frequently even the weight
of a man leaning against a tree was sufficient to knock
it down. I never shall forget how impressed I was the
first time I saw my men cut the way through the forest,
slashing down right and left good-sized trees with one
swing each of their <i>falcon</i>&mdash;heavy-bladed knives some
2 ft. long.</p>

<p>What terrific strength! I thought, until I happened
to lean against a tree, and down went the tree and
myself too. Upon examination I found that merely
the bark remained, with a few filaments inside&mdash;the
rest of the interior having been entirely devoured by
ants. Yet some of the top branches seemed still alive,
and had leaves. Again, even when quite sound, those
trees were extremely an&aelig;mic and soft, quite watery
inside, and could be cut almost as easily as celery.</p>

<p>This does not mean that all the trees of Brazil were
worthless. No, indeed. These remarks apply merely
to that particular portion of Brazil in which I was then
travelling&mdash;where, barring the <i>burity</i> palms in the
moist lands and marshes, the trees were mostly
rickety and dwarfed, with mouldy barks, malformed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-316" id="Pg_1-316"></a>[<a href="./images/1-316.png">316</a>]</span>
limbs, and scanty leaves. That is why, when we came
to the healthy mass of <i>burity</i> palms and the lovely
young grass, one felt just the same as when, after
having been through a hospital, one emerges into the
fresh air among healthy people.</p>

<p>That night we encamped on the heavenly meadow.
We felt we had reached Paradise. For the first time
great flocks of parrots and gorgeously-coloured macaws
played about and enlivened the air with their shrill
whistles and shrieks, and flew over the palms, gently
swung to and fro by the wind. Then innumerable
<i>colibris</i>&mdash;the tiny humming-birds, of marvellous iridescent
metallic tints&mdash;sucked now from one then from
another flower while still flying. Indeed, that spot
seemed the rendez-vous of all the animals of that region.
There you found <i>on&ccedil;as</i> (jaguar), <i>anta</i> (a large pachyderm),
the <i>Tapirus Americanus</i>, the <i>tamandua bandeira</i>,
with its worm-like tongue, (or <i>Myrmecophaga jubata</i>),
and plenty of <i>veado</i> (<i>Cervus elaphus</i>). The footmarks
of all those animals were innumerable near the water.</p>

<p>The man I had left behind in order to make a further
attempt at recovering the lost horse arrived that evening,
his search having been unsuccessful. Undoubtedly
the horse had been stolen.</p>

<p class="fsc">Strange Geometrical Pattern of Lava over Giant Volcanic Dome.</p>
<hr />
<p>Although the place where we had made camp was
a regular paradise to look at&mdash;in the day-time&mdash;it
might have been compared to warmer regions at night.
Mosquitoes of all sizes and of all degrees of viciousness
rose in swarms from the swamp at sunset, and made
our life absolutely miserable. To counterbalance the
torture we had a wonderful sunset to look at. First
the sky, of a golden colour, was intersected by graceful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-317" id="Pg_1-317"></a>[<a href="./images/1-317.png">317</a>]</span>
curves dividing it into sections like a melon; then it
gradually became overladen with horizontal black and
crimson lines to the west, black to the east and overhead.</p>

<p>June the 2nd was my birthday. I am superstitious
by nature, and I would have given anything to celebrate
it with some lucky event, although I was at
a loss to think of anything lucky that could have
happened to me there. Indeed, I began my new year
badly&mdash;much worse even than I expected. That was
an ill-omen to me. First of all there was a terrible
row among my men in camp. They had taken to their
rifles. They wanted to shoot the cook. The man
deserved punishment, perhaps, but not quite so severe
a one. After a great deal of arguing I quieted them and
got them to lay down their weapons. The cook's life
was spared&mdash;worse luck for me. I was sorry for it
when I had my breakfast, for cooking more diabolical
than his could not be imagined. During breakfast
the news came that another horse of my caravan had
been lost. So there was the prospect of another day
wasted to recover it. My men were unable to trace
it, so I resigned myself to the monetary loss and also
to the inconvenience its absence would cause us.</p>

<p>My men felt the cold intensely during the night,
the thermometer being as low as 51&deg; Fahr. (minimum).
During the day the maximum temperature was 85&deg;
Fahr. and 96&deg; in the sun.</p>

<p>My only consolation that day was watching the
innumerable birds and gazing at the magnificent sunset.
The latter consisted that evening of three lines forming
arches&mdash;two black to the west and the third white&mdash;stretching
across the sky from north to south. From<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-318" id="Pg_1-318"></a>[<a href="./images/1-318.png">318</a>]</span>
the higher black line radiations spread, subdividing
the sky into rectangular designs&mdash;of almost equal size.
To the east were great globular masses of mist somewhat
confused in shape.</p>

<p>The water at this camp was bad, the marsh being
over a bed of decayed vegetable matter, which rendered
the water of a brownish black colour, like strong tea.
Its taste was foul. By digging a well a few yards from
the lagoon I succeeded, however, in obtaining clean and
good water, which filtered through the ashes and sand.</p>

<p>Our camp was at an elevation of 2,300 ft. During
the night, June 2nd-3rd, the thermometer was higher
than usual (min. 58&deg; Fahr.), but my men felt the cold
more than the previous night because of the heavy
mist which set in after sunset, followed by a drizzling
rain which damped everything. My men were all
attacked by fever, which rendered them more irritable
and ill-tempered than ever&mdash;if possible.</p>

<p>We did not leave camp until 11.30 a.m., rising again
to the summit of the plateau some 50 ft. higher. There
we had to describe a wide arc of a circle, as through
the trees we perceived on our left an immense chasm,
beyond which was a much disturbed landscape of striking
ruggedness. We could see a huge circular crater with
eroded lips, rising like the chipped edges of a gigantic
cup, in the centre of the great volcanic basin. That
depression with high vertical walls all round displayed a
large gap to the W.N.W. and another to the south-west.</p>

<p>Twelve kilometres from our last camp&mdash;and still
marching along the edge of the circle on the summit of
the plateau&mdash;we came to a grassy <i>cuvette</i>, and then to
another hollow with a few <i>burity</i> palms. The wall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-319" id="Pg_1-319"></a>[<a href="./images/1-319.png">319</a>]</span>
overlooking the great circular depression was perpendicular,
of red igneous rock, with projecting spurs ending
in conical, much-corrugated hills. The curious opening
to the south-west was much broken up in two places
with gaps. In the distance beyond were three ranges of
hills, the colour of which appeared a pure cobalt blue.</p>

<p>The central crater was formed by rugged red walls
with spurs on the east and south-east sides. In the
bottom was water with trees all round its edge. There
were four square holes from which boiling water
gurgled like feeble geysers, and three more holes of a
more irregular shape.</p>

<p>The hill range on which we stood projected well
into the centre of the great circular basin. It had on
the west side perfectly vertical walls of black igneous
rock. Its summit was chiefly formed of ferruginous
erupted rock thrown up while in a state of ebullition,
which had cooled into a conglomerate of minute globular
masses, in shape like the bubbles of boiling water. The
great circle around us, as we stood on the outermost
point of the projecting spur, was most impressive, with
its brilliantly coloured red walls.</p>

<p>My men killed a <i>coat&iacute;</i>&mdash;a peculiar, long-nosed carnivorous
animal, which had characteristics in common
with dogs, monkeys, and pigs. There were two kinds of
<i>coat&iacute;</i> or <i>guat&iacute;</i>, viz. the <i>coat&iacute; de mundeo</i> (<i>Nasua solitaria</i>),
and the <i>coat&iacute; de bando</i> (<i>Nasua socialis</i>). Ours was a
<i>Nasua solitaria</i>. It was a beautiful little animal, about
the size of a small cat, with a wonderfully soft brown
coat on its back, a yellowish red belly and bright
yellow chest and throat. The chin was as white as
snow. The long tail, 1&frac12; ft. long&mdash;was in black and yellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-320" id="Pg_1-320"></a>[<a href="./images/1-320.png">320</a>]</span>
rings. It possessed powerful fangs on both the upper
and lower jaws, a long, black, gritty or granular tongue,
short ears, powerful short fore-paws with long nails&mdash;quite
dog-like; long thighs extremely strong, short
hips and hind legs, with callosity up to the knee&mdash;evidently
to allow that part of the leg to rest flat upon
the ground. The <i>coat&iacute;</i> had velvety black eyes of great
beauty, well set in its small well-shaped head. It was
a wild little fellow, extremely agile, and could kill a
dog much larger than itself with comparative ease.</p>

<p>We circled the eastern and northern part of the
great cauldron, always remaining on the summit of
the plateau at elevations varying from 2,250 to 2,300 ft.
We came upon patches of violet-coloured and then
tobacco-coloured sand, and also upon quantities of
dark brown sand, generally consolidated into easily
friable rock. There were the usual deposits of grey
ashes over the underlying volcanic rock which peeped
through here and there.</p>

<p>On June 4th we were at the Cabe&ccedil;eira Koiteh (temperature,
min. 53&deg; Fahr.; max. 80&deg; Fahr.; elev. 2,100 ft.).
Close to this camp, from an outstretching spur, I
obtained another magnificent view. To the E.S.E.
stretched from north-east to south-west a flat
plateau, and to the east a flat mountainous block with
an eroded passage. Headlands branched off from the
northern side of the ridges in a north-easterly direction.
Between them were basins thickly wooded in their lower
depressions. The north-eastern portion of the flat
range was almost vertical, with many angular and
sharply pointed spurs projecting from it.</p>

<p>In the centre of the greater basin, of which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-321" id="Pg_1-321"></a>[<a href="./images/1-321.png">321</a>]</span>
others were details, a low convex ridge bulged out,
with three conical peaks&mdash;two of them at the highest
point of the curve. Between the first and second
cone two twin sub-craters were visible&mdash;evidently the
two twin circles had formed part of the same crater&mdash;in
the mountain side of the distant range. A third
crater was some distance off to the south-west.</p>

<p>To the south-west in the background was a lovely
view of flat highlands with huge tower-like rocks
standing upright upon them. Then to the S.S.W. a
regular vertical dyke of rock stood on the top of an
elongated conical base.</p>

<p>The elevation on the summit of the spur from
which we obtained this lovely panorama was 2,200 ft.&mdash;or
no more than 100 ft. higher than our camp.</p>

<p>We travelled again that same day on the northern
edge of the great depression, and met three more
<i>cuvettes</i> of grey ashes with an abundant central growth of
<i>buritys</i>. These were at a general elevation of 2,300 ft.,
the bottom of the depression being 50 ft. lower. On
descending from the table-land, through a gap we discerned
far away to the south a long flat-topped plateau
extending from south-west to north-east and having
a precipitous wall-face.</p>

<p>We got down to the Caxoeirinha stream, where we
found an abandoned hut in the eroded hollow of the
stream. The water flowed there over a bed of red
lava and extremely hard conglomerate rock made up
of lava pebbles and solidified ashes. Above this at
the sides of the stream was a stratum some 10 ft. thick
of grey ashes, and above it a stratum 2 ft. thick of
red volcanic dust and sand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-322" id="Pg_1-322"></a>[<a href="./images/1-322.png">322</a>]</span>
As we got higher again and I stood on a projecting
promontory, another wonderful view spread itself
before me. The sun, nearly setting, in glorious white
radiations, cast deep blue and violet-coloured shadows
upon the great abyss to my right (N.W.) which was
a kilometre or more in diameter and more than 300 ft.
deep&mdash;surely another great crater. It seemed as if a
natural wall of rock must have once existed, joining
the promontory on which I stood to the great mass
of prismatic red volcanic rock to the west of us, and
ending in a flat triangle with a wide base. The surface
soil on the height of the peninsula was of spattered
lava and black broiled rock and pellets.</p>

<p>The bottom of the abyss formed two sweeping
undulations&mdash;the second from the centre much higher
than the first&mdash;seemingly a great wave of lava vomited
by the crater, by which probably the destruction of
the wall joining the peninsula had been caused.</p>

<p>To the S.S.E. in the distance stood a high mountain
range&mdash;or rather a great flat-topped plateau of
delicious cobalt blue shades, almost losing itself in
the sky. To the east, completing the circle, were two
other great spurs of red-baked rock, with precipitous,
almost vertical, sides and with much-striated buttresses
that ended in conical mounds&mdash;eroded into that shape
by the action of water and wind.</p>

<p>To the south, beyond, a sloping table-land with a
pronounced dip eastward extended from east to west.
It towered over everything, and was shaped like a
trapezium. In front of this sloping table-land was
another long flat-topped range, stretching from E.S.E.
to W.N.W. Again in front of this, could be seen an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-323" id="Pg_1-323"></a>[<a href="./images/1-323.png">323</a>]</span>
interesting series of prismatic mounds&mdash;like parallel
barriers. To the S.S.W. rose a large mountainous mass&mdash;another
plateau. Then came a second range, cut
into clear pyramids with rectangular bases, and,
beyond, a great expanse of lovely green with some
large mounds of a similar shape to those already described.
Two more pyramids were also to be observed
far, far in the distance, while others of a slightly less
angular shape were noticeable upon the great flat
stretch due west.</p>

<p>Right under us, at the bottom of the precipice,
was thick forest covering, zigzag fashion, the two
depressions, roughly in a general direction of south-east
to north-west. Those two depressions drained that
immense basin. It was there that the streamlet
Caxoeirinha had its birth. The Caxoeirinha flowed
north-west and fell into the Ponte de Pedra River,
which flowed south. Those two streams, with a
number of others, formed the head-waters of the great
S. Louren&ccedil;o River, a formidable tributary of the Rio
Paraguay or Paran&aacute;.</p>

<p>An extraordinary effect of clouds could be seen
that day, and a similar occurrence I saw on many other
occasions upon the table-lands of Matto Grosso. The
clouds reproduced&mdash;upside-down&mdash;the configuration of
the country directly underneath them. That was due,
no doubt, to the air currents diverted by the obstacles
on the earth's surface, which caused the masses of
mist above to assume similar forms&mdash;but of course, as
I have said, upside-down.</p>

<p>We were still at an elevation of 2,150 ft. The
temperature during the night went down to 52&deg; Fahr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-324" id="Pg_1-324"></a>[<a href="./images/1-324.png">324</a>]</span>
My men, as usual, suffered intensely from the cold&mdash;at
least, judging by the noise they made, the moans
and groans and chattering of teeth. They nearly all
had violent toothache. Alcides, too, apparently went
through agony, but he showed a little more manliness
than the rest and did not make quite such a pitiful
exhibition of himself.</p>

<p>It was curious how certain racial characteristics
were difficult to suppress in individuals. Alcides had
some German blood in him&mdash;rather far removed. He
could not speak German, nor did he know anything
about Germany. Yet German characteristics came
out in him constantly. For instance, the uncontrollable
desire to write his own name and that of his
lady-love on trees and rocks all along our passage.
Alcides was really very good at calligraphy, and some
of his inscriptions and ornamentations were real works
of art. Many half-hours did we have to waste at the
different camps, waiting for Alcides to finish up the
record of his passage in that country, and many blades
of penknives&mdash;I had a good supply of them to give as
presents to natives&mdash;did he render useless in incising
the lettering on the trees and stones.</p>

<hr />
<p>Filippe the negro&mdash;who was the best-natured of the
lot&mdash;had become quite swelled-headed with the big
salary he received. Arithmetic was not his forte. As
he could hardly write, he was trying to work out, with
a number of sticks&mdash;each representing one day's salary&mdash;how
much money he had already earned, and how
much more he was likely to earn. It evidently seemed
to him a large fortune&mdash;indeed it was&mdash;and his plans
of what he would do with all that money in the future<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-325" id="Pg_1-325"></a>[<a href="./images/1-325.png">325</a>]</span>
were amusing. First of all, the <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i> in his mind
was the purchase of a <i>mallettinha</i>, a small trunk with
a strong lock, in which to keep his money and his
clothes. I took advantage of this to tell Filippe&mdash;they
were all just like spoiled children&mdash;that the best
place for <i>mallettinhas</i> was Manaos, our chief objective
on the River Amazon, some 1,800 kil. away from that
point as the crow flew, and about four times, at least,
that distance by the way we should travel. Many
times a day I had to repeat to Filippe glowing descriptions
of the wonders of the <i>mallettinhas</i>, and I got him
so enamoured of the <i>mallettinhas</i> to be got at Manaos
that I made certain that Filippe at least would come
along and not leave me. I was sure of one thing&mdash;that
nowhere in the intervening country would he be able
to procure himself a little trunk&mdash;nor, indeed, could
one procure oneself anything else.</p>

<p>I supplied my men with ample tobacco. Filippe
was all day and a great part of the night smoking a
pipe. Owing to constant quarrels among my men, I
had turned him into a cook. When in camp he had
to sit hour after hour watching the boiling of the <i>feij&atilde;o</i>.
Enveloped in clouds of smoke, Filippe with his pipe
sat in a reverie, dreaming about the <i>mallettinha</i>. He
was quite a good fellow, and at any rate he did work
when ordered.</p>

<p>All my men had been given small pocket mirrors&mdash;without
which no Brazilian will travel anywhere. It
was amusing to watch them, a hundred times a day,
gazing at the reflection of their faces in the glasses. It
was nevertheless somewhat trying to one's temper
when one ordered a man to do something and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-326" id="Pg_1-326"></a>[<a href="./images/1-326.png">326</a>]</span>
had to watch him for an endless time admiring his own
features in the little mirror, and one had to repeat the
order half a dozen times before the glass was duly
cleaned with his elbow or upon his trousers and set at
rest, and the order carelessly obeyed. Even Alcides&mdash;who
was far superior to the others in education&mdash;could
not be kept away from his mirror. While riding he
would all the time be gazing at his features instead of
looking at the beautiful scenery around us.</p>

<p>On leaving camp we again reached the summit of
the plateau (elev. 2,300 ft.), with its patches of red
volcanic earth, violet-coloured sand, and snuff-coloured
dust&mdash;extremely fine in quality. After crossing a streamlet
flowing south, we again continued our journey on the
flat plateau, slightly higher at that point, or 2,400 ft.</p>

<p>We were in the great plain crossed by the Ponte de
Pedra rivulet, flowing southward. Once more we obtained
a gorgeous view looking south. Four parallel
ranges stretching roughly from south-east to north-west
stood in all their grandeur before us. They were of
brilliant red volcanic rock. On the second range, from
us, rose a curious square block of rock of gigantic size,
resembling a castle with its door and all. In the
distance, to the south-west, erosion seemed to have
taken place on a great scale in the side of the table-land.</p>

<p>The highest point we had so far reached on the
plateau on which we were travelling since leaving the
Araguaya was 2,400 ft. There again we found another
of the extensive grassy <i>cuvettes</i>&mdash;the flat bottom of
which was only 30 ft. lower than the highest point
of the plateau. A luxuriant growth of <i>burity</i> palms
and <i>birero</i> trees adorned the centre, the latter very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-327" id="Pg_1-327"></a>[<a href="./images/1-327.png">327</a>]</span>
tall and handsome, with smooth white bark and only a
dense tuft of dark green foliage at their tops. In the
<i>cuvettes</i> I saw, the growth of the tall vegetation invariably
ran the long way of the oval.</p>

<p>The sky that evening showed great streaks of
transparent lines of mist from west to east, the central
radiation of these being formed of lines so precisely
parallel that they seemed to have been drawn with
rule and dividers. Directly overhead those lines
gradually blended into a more indefinite mass. The
radiations did not begin from the vanishing sun on the
horizon, nor at the point diametrically opposite on the
east, but began to appear only one-tenth up the entire
circle of the sky, both west and east.</p>

<p>Almost globular cloudlets, with the lower section
cut off in a horizontal plane&mdash;quite typical, as we have
seen, of the cloud formation on that Central Brazilian
plateau&mdash;crowded the sky, quite low to the north, and
also a great many small ball-like clouds which showed
with some brilliancy against the blue sky.</p>

<p>The sunsets in Central Brazil were to me always a
source of intense joy, interest, and admiration. With
certain characteristics which repeated themselves frequently,
they always displayed wonderful effects of
light and a most peculiar formation of clouds.</p>

<p>Before reaching camp we passed another oval
<i>cuvette</i> with a longitudinal row of trees&mdash;so green and
tidy as to be just like a portion of a well-kept English
park (elev. 2,350 ft.). Another bit of wonderful scenery,
with immense prismatic rocky mountains&mdash;really more
like dykes&mdash;appeared in the distance; and also a
vertical walled mountain in the foreground.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A Beautiful Lagoon&mdash;Strange Lunar Display&mdash;Waves of Lava&mdash;Curious
Grottoes&mdash;Rock Carvings&mdash;A Beautiful Waterfall</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> camped at the Lagoa Formosa&mdash;or "Beautiful
Lagoon"&mdash;a large, verdant, oval-shaped lagoon, entirely
covered with grass, only 140 ft. lower than the top of
the plateau (elev. 2,290 ft.). Barring a slight undulation
in the land to the north-east of the marsh, the
country was there absolutely flat.</p>

<p>At night I witnessed a marvellous lunar effect. The
half-moon was high up in the sky. Soon after sunset
two immense concentric arches of mist, with their
centres on the horizon to the east, shone like silver
rings, their upper edges being lighted by the bluish
light of the moon. With the reflection of this in the
still waters of the lagoon, the effect was enchanting
and intensely picturesque.</p>

<p>My men suffered a great deal from the damp&mdash;they
were always suffering from everything: from the
heat of the sun, the rain, the cold, the long marches.</p>

<p>That night we had a minimum temperature of
51&deg; Fahr., the elevation of our camp being 2,150 ft.</p>

<p>Naturally, over the expanse of water the sunrise
was wonderful. The sky was well covered by feathery
radiations from the north-east, which were intersected
by striations shooting skyward from east to west and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-329" id="Pg_1-329"></a>[<a href="./images/1-329.png">329</a>]</span>
forming a charming design. The radiations from the
north-east reached right across the sky as far as the
horizon to the south-west. What astonished me most
in Matto Grosso was the characteristic immobility of
the clouds. In the day-time they remained sometimes
for hours with hardly any changes or movement. As
soon as the sun appeared, rendering the lower sky of
a golden yellow and of vivid Indian red above, the
northern part of the lagoon was enveloped in mist,
which rose in angular blocks, vertical on the south
side, slanting at a sharp angle on the north. These
pointed peaks of mist remained immobile&mdash;as if they
had been solid&mdash;until the sun was well up in the sky.</p>

<p>I went once more to gaze at the glorious panorama.
In the morning light new and important details were
revealed, such as a strange series of dykes of a prismatic
shape, of which I could count as many as seven. Great
transverse depressions or grooves&mdash;from S.S.E. to
N.N.W., with a dip S.S.E.&mdash;could in that light be now
plainly detected, and this time two great square castles
of rock&mdash;instead of one&mdash;were disclosed upon the third
range of undulations.</p>

<p>The high ridge to the south-west displayed a subsidence
on a large scale in its central portion, where
bare vertical red walls had been left standing on each
side.</p>

<p>Then there were other curious concave depressions
or gateways formed in the great table-land&mdash;which had
for its marked characteristic concave curves on all its
slopes.</p>

<p>On leaving camp&mdash;nearly at noon, after a serious
quarrel and fight among my men, which left me worried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-330" id="Pg_1-330"></a>[<a href="./images/1-330.png">330</a>]</span>
to death by the petty nonsense and incessant grumbling
of my followers&mdash;we journeyed at an elevation of
2,300 ft., finding shortly after an almost circular <i>cuvette</i>
of deep grey cinders, 100 ft. deep (elevation at the
bottom 2,200 ft.).</p>

<p>Twelve kilometres farther on we came upon another
great depression extending from east to west, with an
enormous belt of grassy land. There was the usual
cluster of trees and palms in the centre, but larger
than usual. To the south were campos&mdash;lovely
prairies&mdash;with sparse and stunted trees&mdash;chiefly <i>Goma
arabica</i> or acacias.</p>

<p>The elevation of the upper edge of the <i>cuvette</i> was
2,500 ft., that of the bottom 2,450 ft. We continued
our journey on the top of the plateau, with slight
undulations varying in height from 50 to 70 ft. Snuff-coloured
soil and red sand were invariably noticeable
on the higher points, and grey ashes in the lower points,
where erosion had caused depressions.</p>

<p>Then, farther on, the plateau, with an elevation of
2,450 ft., was absolutely flat for several kilometres, and
showed sparse vegetation and miserable-looking an&aelig;mic
trees&mdash;the thin soil over solid rock affording them inadequate
nourishment.</p>

<p>Eighteen kilometres from our last camp we came
upon another oval basin (elev. 2,400 ft. above the sea
level), extending longitudinally from N.N.E. to S.S.W.
On its huge deposits of cinders grew deliciously green,
fresh-looking, healthy grass, and a thick clump of
<i>burity</i> palms, and <i>birero</i> trees of immense height and
thick foliage. Those beautiful trees were called by the
people of Goyaz "<i>cutib&aacute;</i>" and "<i>pintahyba</i>." They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-331" id="Pg_1-331"></a>[<a href="./images/1-331.png">331</a>]</span>
were marvellous in their wonderful alignment among the
surrounding circle of gorgeous palms. The latter were
in their turn screened in their lower part by a belt
of low scrub&mdash;so that upon looking at that oasis one
could hardly realize that it had not been geometrically
laid out by the hands of a skilful gardener.</p>

<p>On the outer rim of the <i>cuvette</i>&mdash;away from the
moisture&mdash;hundreds, in fact, thousands of cones, cylinders
and domes, from 4 to 6 ft. high, the work of ants,
could be seen, all constructed of bluish grey ashes.</p>

<p>We had here a wonderful example, quite sufficient
to persuade the most sceptical, of the influence of
agglomerations of trees in the formation of clouds.
The sky was perfectly clear everywhere except directly
above the extensive cluster of trees in the large <i>cuvette</i>.
Quite low down&mdash;only a hundred feet or so above the
top of the trees&mdash;there hung a heavy white cloud. It
was a windless day. The cloud ended on all sides
exactly where the trees ended, as sharply as if it had
been cut with a knife. It looked exactly like a rectangular
canopy over the luxuriant vegetation. This
appearance was intensified by undulations in the lower
part of the cloud, like festoons.</p>

<p>In proceeding across the immense circular <i>cuvette</i>
I found that the central line of thick vegetation formed
an angle. A streamlet of delicious crystal-like water
emerged from among the trees. On its bank lay the
skeletons of three mules, suggesting a tragedy.</p>

<p>On leaving the great <i>cuvette</i> we rose again to the top
of the plateau, 2,550 ft. above sea level. On descending
from a large dome to the west over red volcanic
sand and red earth, half consolidated into rock easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-332" id="Pg_1-332"></a>[<a href="./images/1-332.png">332</a>]</span>
friable under slight pressure, we were once more travelling
across immense campos in a depression of fine
cinders and earth, extending from north to south, at an
elevation of 2,400 ft. We further traversed two other
less important depressions, the deepest being at an
elevation of 2,350 ft.</p>

<p>The jutting headlands of the plateau on which we
had travelled were all most precipitous&mdash;nearly vertical&mdash;and
of solid dark red volcanic rock.</p>

<p>A magnificent view next confronted us to the south.
A huge black square block with a crater was before
us, and there appeared what seemed to me to be the
remaining sections of a huge volcanic vent and several
smaller funnels. The lower lip of the crater formed a
terrace. Then another wider crater could be perceived
in a circular hollow of the spur of the plateau on
which we had travelled, and which stretched out into
the underlying plain. That spur extended from north-east
to south-west, and in it two circular hollows of
great size could be noticed, the sides of which were
deeply fluted.</p>

<p>During the entire march that day we had seen
quantities of violet-coloured deposits made up of tiny
crystals, carbonized and pulverized rock and ferruginous
dust.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Giant Wave of Lava.</p>
<hr />
<p>On descending from the summit of the plateau, by
a very steep slope, we saw many shrubs of <i>sapatinho</i>, a
medicinal plant of the genus <i>euphorbiace&aelig;</i> (Euphorbia),
growing in the interstices of red igneous rock, and
among quantities of d&eacute;bris of marble, crystals, and
eruptive pebbles.</p>

<p>During the night we had a magnificent lunar display.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-333" id="Pg_1-333"></a>[<a href="./images/1-333.png">333</a>]</span>
There was a good deal of moisture in the air, and
mist. First of all a gorgeous lunar halo was observed,
which later vanished to leave room for a most extraordinary
geometrical design upon the partly moon-illuminated
clouds and masses of mist. A most perfect
luminous equilateral triangle appeared, with its apex
downwards to the west and the half-moon in the
central point of the base-line of the triangle above.
On either side of the apex of the triangle faint concentric
circles blended away into the sky near the horizon.
Later in the night that curious effect disappeared and a
multiple lunar rainbow of amazing beauty and perfection
was to be admired.</p>

<p>In ecstasy at the beautiful sight, and in a moment
of forgetfulness, I drew the attention of my men to
the wonderful spectacle.</p>

<p>"That's the moon!" they answered, with a snarl.
Talking among themselves, they contemptuously added:
"<i>He</i> has never seen the moon before!" and they went
on with the never-changing, blood-curdling tales of
murders which filled them nightly with delight.</p>

<p>The streamlet flowing south, on the bank of which
we camped, took its name of Sapatinho from the many
<i>sapatinho</i> trees which were in the neighbourhood. It
was a curious watercourse, which disappeared into a
tunnel in the rock, to reappear only farther off out of a
hole in a red lava-flow.</p>

<p>We had marched until late into the night, and it
was not until we arrived and made camp that I noticed
that Filippe the negro was missing. Several hours
elapsed, and as he had not turned up I feared that
something had happened to him. Had he been one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-334" id="Pg_1-334"></a>[<a href="./images/1-334.png">334</a>]</span>
of the other men I should have thought it a case of
desertion; but Filippe was a good fellow, and I had
from the beginning felt that he and Alcides would
be the two faithful men on that expedition. I went
back alone a mile or two in the moonlight to try and
find him, but with no success.</p>

<p>At sunrise I ordered two men to go in search of him.
The fellows&mdash;who had no mercy whatever even for one
another&mdash;were loth to go back to look for their companion
and his mount. When they eventually started
they took a pick each to dig his grave in case they
found him dead. Fortunately they had only been
gone from camp a few minutes when I perceived Filippe
riding down the steep incline.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature was only 55&deg; Fahr.
during the night, but it was so damp that my men felt
the cold intensely, especially as there were gusts of a
sharp breeze from the north-east. Moreover, in the
deep hollow with thick grass in which we camped (elev.
2,200 ft. above the sea level) we suffered absolute torture
from the swarms of <i>carrapatos</i> of all sizes, mosquitoes,
and flies. The air and earth were thick with
them. The water was dirty and almost undrinkable,
as it passed through a lot of decomposing vegetation.</p>

<p>I was glad when Filippe reappeared and we were
able to leave that terrible spot. Great undulations were
now met with, 300 ft. and more in height.</p>

<p>Only 1&frac12; kil. farther on we came to the Presidente
stream, flowing south (elev. 2,100 ft.) over a bed of ashes,
while its banks were formed of thick deposits of finely
powdered yellow volcanic sand and dust.</p>

<p>We went over a huge dome covered with a stratum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-335" id="Pg_1-335"></a>[<a href="./images/1-335.png">335</a>]</span>
of brown sand, exposing on its western side a large
wall of igneous rock with much-fissured strata dipping
to the north-west. Immense isolated rocks showed
vertical strata, demonstrating plainly that they had
been considerably disturbed at some epoch or other.</p>

<p>We were on the bank of another stream (elev. 1,950 ft.)
flowing south&mdash;the Capim Branco. We were then in
another great and deep basin extending from north-west
to south-east, in the north-western part of which
could be seen on the summit of the rounded hill-tops
and spurs an overlapping of rock, evidently produced
when in a molten condition. In the south-western
part of the slope encircling this great valley there stood
another great barrier, formed also by a flow of molten
rock curling over itself, as it were, and above this stood
angular and pointed shoots of molten stuff of a subsequent
origin. Large slabs of the latter could be
separated easily from the underlying flow.</p>

<p>From the summit of that rocky prominence was
obtained a lovely panorama of a great plateau, a portion
of which had been eroded into a wall (E.N.E.) with
three buttresses: another portion was gradually assuming
a similar shape. The plateau had a great spur
projecting westward. A crater had formed with a
broken-up side to the west, leaving the conical-shaped
remains of its fragmentary mouth. The plateau ended
after describing a sweeping curve&mdash;almost a semicircle.</p>

<p>In the centre of the immense basin before us were
successions of high undulations&mdash;like great waves&mdash;extending
southward in parallel lines (east to west).
From the point of vantage on which I stood I could
count as many as eight of those huge lines of waves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-336" id="Pg_1-336"></a>[<a href="./images/1-336.png">336</a>]</span>
Evidently at some remote period&mdash;it would be difficult
to say how many thousands of years ago&mdash;that was a
gigantic mass of molten stuff in commotion. In many
places it was apparent that the great waves of molten
rock had flowed over and partly overlapped the lower
ones. In its higher north-easterly point the basin
was wooded.</p>

<p>The great basin extended southward. In that
direction all the lower ridges with their arched backs
showed a depression or dip. On the S.S.W. two
more great domes of wonderfully perfect curves were
to be observed, and on the south-west stood an
isolated gigantic quadrangular mountain of solid rock,
with the usual buttresses in the lower portion typical
of that region.</p>

<p>To the south-east a lovely square-shaped plateau
of marvellously graceful lines stood prominent in the
centre of the basin. In the same direction, only a
few hundred yards off, was a most peculiar angular
rock, which looked exactly like the magnified crest
of an immense wave. That was just what it had
been formerly&mdash;the wave, of course, of a gigantic
molten mass of rock, set in violent motion by an immeasurable
force. It was the terminal point of the
great succession of rocky waves which we had skirted
to the north in order to arrive at that point, and
which extended from the great semicircle we had
passed the previous day.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-336.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-336_th.jpg" alt="Strange Rock-Carvings of Matto Grosso." title="Strange Rock-Carvings of Matto Grosso." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Strange Rock-Carvings of Matto Grosso.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the terminal point of those rocky waves&mdash;or
wherever the rock was exposed&mdash;it was evident that
all those undulations had received a similar movement
and had formed the great backbone range of rock,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-337" id="Pg_1-337"></a>[<a href="./images/1-337.png">337</a>]</span>
fully exposed in the last undulation. I had observed
the continuation of this great rock crest the previous day
in the basin previous to reaching the Capim Branco
valley. There it crossed the spur on which I was&mdash;"Observation
Spur," I shall call it for purposes of
identification&mdash;almost at right angles. It seemed as
if two forces had been acting simultaneously but in
different directions, and at various points had come
into conflict and eventually had overrun each other.</p>

<p>The last great rocky crest at Capim Branco, when
seen in profile, looked like a huge monolith with a slight
inclination to the south-east. The formation of the
rock itself showed a frothy appearance, such as is
common with any liquefied matter while in a state of
ebullition.</p>

<p>It is quite possible, too, that the great wave of
molten matter travelling from north-east to south-west,
upon encountering some obstacle, had its run interrupted
and had cooled down, while the upper portion
of it, from the impetus received, curled over the summit
of the arrested solidified rock below.</p>

<p>In fact, there was plenty of evidence to show that
while the lower stratum cooled down other sheets of
lava flowed above it, forming many successive layers.
In the eastern part, where they were at an angle of 40&deg;,
these had cracked considerably in cooling. The central
part of the great wave was entirely made up of vertically
fissured strata. The lower half of the mass of rock
showed markedly that it was an anterior wave to the
upper.</p>

<p>There was a wide gap formed by the volcanic crack
between this and the continuation of the undulations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-338" id="Pg_1-338"></a>[<a href="./images/1-338.png">338</a>]</span>
to the south-west, which got lower and lower. Perhaps
before the crack occurred that hill was like the others on
the east and west of it, padded with red earth. It must
have become barren by the great shock which caused
the surface of the earth to divide, and which no doubt
shook the surface deposits down. In examining its
north-eastern neighbour it could be seen that it actually
tumbled over when the subsidence occurred, leaving a
gap a few hundred metres wide.</p>

<p>A short distance beyond, on the S.S.E., was an
interesting table-land sloping to the north-east, on the
north side of which could be observed yet one more
beautiful semicircular extinct crater. The rim, or lip
of lava of this crater, had fissured in such a peculiar
way as to give the appearance of a row of rectangular
windows. The sections of the crater which remained
standing showed two conical buttresses above massive
cylindrical bases. From the crater started a huge,
deep crack, 30 to 50 ft. deep and 20 to 100 ft. wide,
which farther down became the actual bed of the
stream. On both sides of this crack was a deep deposit
of red earth and sand, the stratum below this being
a solid mass of lava. The crater on the north-east side
of the mountain had an inclination to the north, but
was quite vertical on the south side.</p>

<p>Beautiful crystals were to be found in abundance
on this mound, as well as great quantities of marble
chips and crystallized rock in various forms.</p>

<p>On the side of this strange mound of rock I found
some curious shallow caves, formed by great fissures
in the rock. The vertical outer walls of these caves
were painted white with lime dissolved in water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-339" id="Pg_1-339"></a>[<a href="./images/1-339.png">339</a>]</span>
There were some puzzling carvings, which interested me
greatly. I could not quite make up my mind at first
whether those carvings had been made by Indians or
whether they were the work of escaped negro slaves
who had found shelter in those distant caves. In
character they appeared to me Indian. Negroes, as
a rule, are not much given to rock-carving in order to
record thoughts or events. Moreover, those primitive
carvings showed strong characteristics of hunting people,
such as the Indians were. There were conventional
attempts at designing human figures&mdash;both male and
female&mdash;by mere lines such as a child would draw:
one round dot for the head and one line each for the
body, arms, and legs. Curiously enough&mdash;and this
persuaded me that the drawings had been done by
Indians&mdash;none of the figures possessed more than three
fingers or toes to any extremity. As we have seen,
the Indians cannot count beyond three&mdash;unlike members
of most African tribes, who can all count at least up to
five. This, nevertheless, did not apply to representations
of footmarks, both human and animal&mdash;which
were reproduced with admirable fidelity, I think because
the actual footprints on the rock itself had been
used as a guide before the carving had been made. I
saw the representation of a human footmark, the left,
with five toes, and the shape of the foot correctly drawn.
Evidently the artist or a friend had stood on his right
foot while applying the left to the side of the rock.
When they attempted to draw a human foot on a scale
smaller than nature, they limited themselves to carving
two lines at a wide angle, to form the heel, and five
dots to represent the toes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-340" id="Pg_1-340"></a>[<a href="./images/1-340.png">340</a>]</span>
The most wonderful of those rock carvings were
the footprints of the jaguar (<i>on&ccedil;a</i>), reproduced with
such perfection that it seemed almost as if they had
been left there by the animal itself. Not so happy
were the representations of human heads&mdash;one evidently
of an Indian chief, with an aureole of feathers, showing
a painfully distorted vision on the part of the artist.
The eyes were formed by two circles in poor alignment,
the nose by a vertical line, and the mouth, not under
but by the side of the nose, represented by two concentric
curves.</p>

<p>A figure in a sitting posture was interesting enough&mdash;like
a T upside down, with a globe for a head and a
cross-bar for arms. The hands had three fingers each,
but there were only two toes to each foot.</p>

<p>It was interesting to note how the sculptors of those
images caught, in a rudimentary way, the character
of the subjects represented. This was chiefly remarkable
in the footprints of birds and other animals,
such as deer. They seemed particularly fond of representing
deer-horns&mdash;sometimes with double lines at
an angle. That was possibly to commemorate hunting
expeditions. A frequent subject of decoration was a
crude representation of the female organ; and one a
magnified resemblance, angularly drawn, of an Indian
male organ garbed in its typical decoration.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-340.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-340_th.jpg" alt="Weird Lunar Effect witnessed by Author." title="Weird Lunar Effect witnessed by Author." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Weird Lunar Effect witnessed by Author.</p>
<hr />
<p>The face of the rock was absolutely covered with
drawings, many being mere reproductions of the same
design. Some were so rudimentary that they were
absolutely impossible to identify. One fact was certain,
that those carvings had been made by men who were
trackers by nature and who observed chiefly what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-341" id="Pg_1-341"></a>[<a href="./images/1-341.png">341</a>]</span>
they noticed on the ground, instead of around and
above them. Thus, there were no representations
whatever of foliage or trees, no attempts at reproducing
birds, or the sun, the moon, the stars.</p>

<p>The most interesting of all, from an ethnological
point of view, were the geometrical designs. They
closely resembled the incised lines and punch-marks of
the Australian aborigines, and the patterns common
in Polynesia. Concentric circles&mdash;of more or less perfection&mdash;were
common, some with a central cross of
three and four parallel lines. Coils seemed beyond the
drawing powers of Indian artists. Ovals, triangles,
squares, the Egyptian cross (T-shaped), series of detached
circles (these generally enclosed within a triangle,
quadrangle or lozenge) were frequent. Even more
frequent were the parallel incised lines, generally used
as subsidiary filling or shading of other patterns, such
as concentric circles, or sections of triangles or squares.</p>

<p>It may be noted that a certain intelligence was
displayed by the artist in dividing circles fairly accurately
into four and eight sections, the diameters
intersecting pretty well in the centre of the circles.
One pattern which seemed to take their fancy was
that of an oval or a circle with a number of dots inside.</p>

<p>In examining the cave closely, inside and outside,
I also found upon the wall, which was simply covered
with those images, some curious marks resembling the
letters H P, A P, and W <a href="./images/ill1-341.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-341_th.jpg" alt="Symbol." title="Symbol." /></a>, which seemed of a more
recent date&mdash;perhaps left there by some missionary
Father or native explorer, or by some escaped slave.</p>

<p>Just below the point where the stream Capim Branco
entered the S. Louren&ccedil;o River (elev. 1,800 ft. above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-342" id="Pg_1-342"></a>[<a href="./images/1-342.png">342</a>]</span>
the sea level), there was a most beautiful waterfall&mdash;the
Salto Floriano Peixoto. Two minor falls, some 30 ft.
high (Salto Benjamin) were also to be seen under arches
of luxuriant vegetation, just above the point of junction
of the two streams.</p>

<p>The roaring and foaming volume of water of the
greater fall rolled over a vertical volcanic rock, about
60 ft. high and 60 ft. wide, with a small terrace half way
up its face. The bed of the river&mdash;below the fall&mdash;was,
like all the torrents of that region, of strangely
shaped lava blocks. With the dense foliage, the innumerable
<i>cait&eacute;</i>, a medicinal plant with huge leaves,
the festooned liane and creepers&mdash;all most verdant in
the sombre green light filtering through the foliage
and the moisture of the abundant spray from the fall&mdash;it
was indeed a magnificent sight. In order to see it,
however, one had to suffer a great deal, because in
forcing one's way through the dense vegetation one got
literally covered with <i>carrapatos</i> and <i>carrapatinhos</i>.</p>

<p>Above the falls, for some hundreds of yards, there
were terrific rapids in the river, which flowed over
a steep bed of yellow lava in terraces, over steps and
over a fourth minor fall some distance off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-343" id="Pg_1-343"></a>[<a href="./images/1-343.png">343</a>]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In Search of the Highest Point of the Brazilian Plateau&mdash;Mutiny&mdash;Great
Domes&mdash;Travelling by Compass&mdash;A Gigantic Fissure in the Earth's
Crust</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">I made</span> up my mind that I would continue my journey
westward no farther, and would now proceed due north
in order to explore the most important part of the
Central Plateau&mdash;the very heart of Brazil&mdash;precisely
where the great Rivers Xingu and Tapajoz had their
birth. I believed that we should there find the highest
point of the Central Brazilian Plateau. I expected to
find in that region the most interesting portion of my
journey&mdash;from the geographical, anthropological, and
geological points of view. I was greatly disappointed
from the anthropological aspect, since I met no one at
all; but from the geological and geographical I was
certainly well repaid for my trouble, great as the trouble
was. We had already ridden to a distance of 1,400 kil.
from the nearest railway.</p>

<p class="fsc">Rock-Carvings in Matto Grosso.</p>
<hr />
<p>My men mutinied on hearing of my plan, which I
had kept concealed from them. They acted in a most
abject manner. They tried to compel me to return the
way we had come instead of going forward. As I flatly
refused, they claimed their pay and wished to leave
me there and then. Without an instant's hesitation
they were handed their pay up to date and told they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-345" id="Pg_1-345"></a>[<a href="./images/1-345.png">345</a>]</span>
could go. The men had not quite realized that they
would have to walk back some 858 kil. to Goyaz,
without food and without animals. Alcides and Filippe
the negro had remained faithful, and on that occasion
stood by my side. Unfortunately, Alcides, who had a
most violent temper, quarrelled with Filippe over some
paltry matter and drove him over to the inimical camp.</p>

<p>So that there I was&mdash;with only one man left. I
am not much given to losing heart over anything.
Alcides showed a strong heart on that occasion. He
and I proceeded for three days to rearrange the baggage
and mend the saddles, etc., in order that we two
alone might take along the entire caravan of animals.
I did not at all look forward to the extra work of
packing all the animals twice a day, and twice a day
unpacking them. The loads weighed about fifty pounds
each, and there were some thirty of them. Then we
should have to hunt for the animals in the morning&mdash;a
job which meant that one had to ride sometimes for
miles to track them and bring them all back to camp.
This prospect, on top of the work I had already in
hand of writing, taking astronomical and meteorological
observations, photography, developing negatives, drawing,
collecting and classifying botanical and geological
specimens, which occupied all day and the greater part
of the night, was a little too much for me. But such
was my joy at having got rid of my unpleasant companions
that I would have put up with any additional
discomfort and inconvenience in order to get on.
Alcides behaved splendidly on that occasion.</p>

<p>June 8th and 9th were absolutely wasted. The
relief from the mental strain of constantly looking after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-346" id="Pg_1-346"></a>[<a href="./images/1-346.png">346</a>]</span>&mdash;and
being on my guard against&mdash;my companions was
great. They were days of great happiness to me.</p>

<p>On June 10th Alcides and I were making ready to
depart, with all the animals and baggage, when the
four mutinous followers and Filippe the negro&mdash;most
penitent&mdash;begged to be re-employed. Under ordinary
circumstances I should certainly never have taken
them back; but when one was hundreds of miles from
everywhere, and had no possible way of finding a man,
one had to be patient and make the best of what one
could get. I gave them another chance&mdash;principally in
order to save what I could of my baggage, most of
which I was certain I should have had to abandon had
I proceeded alone with Alcides.</p>

<p>The Capim Branco river was situated between two
undulating ridges of lava.</p>

<p>I steered a course of 300&deg; bearings magnetic (N.W.),
beginning a steep climb at once through the thin
forest of the plateau to the north. In many places
the mules slid and rolled down the precipitous slope
of igneous rock and marble d&eacute;bris, scattering the packs
in every direction. It was a wonder they were not
killed. We urged the animals on, we pushed and pulled
them, we held them with all our might by the bridles
when they began to slide. After many narrow escapes
we reached the summit&mdash;an immense flat stretch of
campos with stunted trees and delicious crisp air&mdash;quite
delightful after the stifling atmosphere of the Capim
Branco basin. The elevation above the sea level was
2,300 ft. On the summit of the plateau was a deep
stratum of red soil. Having marched across the entire
width of the plateau, we found, on descending on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-347" id="Pg_1-347"></a>[<a href="./images/1-347.png">347</a>]</span>
opposite side, another series of dome-like mounds of
crimson volcanic rock, with hardly any vegetation
on them&mdash;joined together, and forming many headlands,
as it were. Beyond an empty space&mdash;an opening
in the landscape&mdash;a great barrier crossed the range of
domes almost at right angles.</p>

<p>We descended through thick undergrowth, under
big <i>jatoba do matto</i> (<i>Hymenc&aelig;a Courbaril</i> L.) trees. The
<i>jatoba</i> or <i>jatahy</i> wood has a high specific gravity, and
is considered one of the woods with the highest resistance
to disintegration in Brazil&mdash;as high as 1 kg.
315 gr. per square centimetre.</p>

<p>At 2,050 ft. we found a streamlet flowing southward.
We were then in a grassy basin&mdash;another
<i>cuvette</i> with two central tufts of thickly packed trees.
We were lucky enough to see some <i>coco babento</i> palms,
from which we shook down dates which were excellent,
although somewhat troublesome to eat, owing to the
innumerable filaments protecting the central large stone.
These filaments stuck between one's teeth, and were
most difficult to remove. The dates were the size and
shape of an ordinary English walnut and extremely oily.</p>

<p>It was a real joy to see fine healthy trees again, after
the miserable specimens we had seen of late. Even
there, too, the powerful trees which emerged from the
lower entangled scrub and dense foliage were greatly
contorted, as if they had gone through a terrific effort
in order to push their way through to reach the light
and air. Liane innumerable and of all sizes hung
straight or festooned from the highest trees or coiled
in a deadly embrace round their branches like snakes.
Nor were they the only enemies of trees. Large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-348" id="Pg_1-348"></a>[<a href="./images/1-348.png">348</a>]</span>
swellings could be noticed around most of the trees,
caused by the terrible <i>cupim</i> (<i>termes album</i>) or white
ants, carrying out their destructive work just under
the bark. Many indeed were the trees absolutely
killed by those industrious little devils.</p>

<p>As we marched through the <i>matto</i>, using the large
knives freely to open our way, we had to make great
deviations in our course&mdash;now because of a giant
<i>jatoba</i> lying dead upon the ground, then to give a wide
berth to a group of graceful <i>akuri</i> palms, with their
huge spiky leaves. Those palms had great bunches of
fruit. We were beginning now to find trees with fan-like
extensions at the roots and base, such as I had
frequently met with in the forests of Mindanao Island
(Philippine Archipelago), where they were called
<i>caripapa</i> and <i>nonoko</i> trees. The <i>vines</i> or <i>liane</i> were
getting interesting, some being of great length and of
colossal size, twisted round like a ship's cable.</p>

<p>We rose again to an elevation of 2,600 ft. On emerging
from the cool dark forest and its refreshing green
light, we found ourselves on another plateau with a
slightly arched summit, of beautiful campos. From
that height we looked over the immense undulating
plain to the south. To the south-east we gazed upon
a lower flat-topped plateau bounding the valley which,
in great sweeping undulations from south-east to
north-west, resembled an ocean with waves of colossal
magnitude. We travelled across the slightly domed
grassy plateau, and found on it a <i>cuvette</i>&mdash;only slightly
depressed this time, but with the usual central
line of tall trees with luxuriant foliage, <i>burity</i> palms
and <i>pintahyba</i> trees. There, too, we had a surface<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-349" id="Pg_1-349"></a>[<a href="./images/1-349.png">349</a>]</span>
stratum of red earth and fine brown dust, with an under
stratum of grey ashes. Soon after we came to a second
<i>cuvette</i>, and farther north a third could be perceived.
In fact, the summit of that particular table-land was
made up of subsidiary domes dividing <i>cuvette</i> from
<i>cuvette</i> in succession.</p>

<p>In going down to 2,550 ft. we found a streamlet
flowing northwest into the Rio das Mortes&mdash;or "River
of Death." We were there on the great divide between
the waters flowing south into the S. Louren&ccedil;o and eventually
into the Paran&aacute;, and those flowing north&mdash;after
thousands of kilometres&mdash;into the Amazon. This little
rivulet was therefore interesting to me, for it was the
first one I had met flowing north since leaving the
Araguaya&mdash;although not the first whose waters eventually
flowed in a circuitous way into the Amazon.</p>

<p>That was a day of great domes&mdash;all of them with
perfect curves. On them the grazing was magnificent.
To the north a wonderful green dome, larger than the
others (elev. 2,650 ft.), would have been splendid for
cattle raising. Not a sign of life could be seen anywhere.
Seldom have I seen nature so still and devoid
of animal life. What immensity of rich land wasted!
It made one's heart bleed to see it. There was everything
there to make the fortunes of a hundred thousand
farmers&mdash;yet there was not a soul! There was
good grazing, plenty of water. There were no roads,
no trails, it is true, but with a little enterprise it
would be easy to make them. With a railway passing
through, that now wasted land should become the
richest on earth.</p>

<p>In a depression (elev. 2,450 ft.) we came to a stream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-350" id="Pg_1-350"></a>[<a href="./images/1-350.png">350</a>]</span>let
also flowing north, which had made the soil extremely
swampy. We had endless trouble in getting across,
the animals sinking and sticking in the black mud up
to their necks. One of the mules&mdash;more reckless than
the others&mdash;actually disappeared, baggage and all, while
madly struggling to extricate itself from the sucking
slush and mud. It took all our efforts combined to
save that animal. By the time we had all got across,
men, animals, and baggage were a sight worth looking
at&mdash;all filthy, absolutely smothered in black mud.</p>

<p>We rose upon yet another dome, and then descended
to the Rio Manso or Rio das Mortes, the head-waters
of which were not far from there, to the south-west,
in the Serra da Chapada. The river was there only
15 metres wide, but too deep and rapid for the animals
to ford, so we had to follow its bank in order to find a
suitable spot. The River das Mortes flowed, roughly,
first in an easterly then in a north-easterly direction,
and soon, swollen by innumerable streams, became the
most powerful tributary of the Araguaya River, which
it met almost opposite the centre of the great island of
Bananal. In fact, one might almost consider the
head-waters of the Rio das Mortes as the secondary
sources of the great Araguaya. The Rio das Mortes
flowed, at the particular spot where we met it, due
north, along the edge of the great dome. The elevation
of the top edge was 2,470 ft.</p>

<p>We camped that night on the Riber&atilde;o do Boi, a
swift torrent tributary of the Rio das Mortes (elev.
2,250 ft.), having marched 30 kil. that day. The cold
was relatively severe during the night&mdash;the thermometer
registering a minimum of 48&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-351" id="Pg_1-351"></a>[<a href="./images/1-351.png">351</a>]</span>
We were travelling entirely by prismatic compass.
My men&mdash;who had no faith whatever in what they
called the <i>agulha</i> (compass)&mdash;swore that we were going
to sure perdition.</p>

<p>"How can that <i>agulha</i>," said they, "possibly tell
you where we can find beans (<i>feij&atilde;o</i>), lard (<i>toucinho</i>), and
sugar bricks (<i>rapadura</i>)?" "It is the invention of
some madman!" said one. "It will bring us to our
death," sadly reflected another. "If I had only known
that we should be entrusting our lives all the time to
that <i>agulha</i>," murmured a third, pointing contemptuously
to the compass, "I should have never come.
Oh, my poor mother and wife! And my dear little
daughter six months old! Oh, shall I ever see them
again ... shall I ever see them again?" Here followed
a stream of bitter tears, wiped with the ragged sleeve
of his shirt.</p>

<p>I thought that a cold bath would do them all good.
I ordered them to take all the animals and baggage
across the stream. It was a job of some difficulty,
owing to the very swift current. A rough bridge had
to be constructed over the most dangerous part. The
water was freezingly cold.</p>

<p>On leaving the river we at once rose again over
another great dome (elev. 2,350 ft.), from which we
obtained a most glorious view of other grassy domes,
smooth-looking and well-rounded, with a fringe of
forest in the depressions between. Down below we
could see the Rio das Mortes we had left behind. It
came at that spot from the south-east, and after describing
an angle turned to the north-east. From the
north-west, at an elevation of 2,300 ft., descended the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-352" id="Pg_1-352"></a>[<a href="./images/1-352.png">352</a>]</span>
Taperinho, a small tributary which entered the Rio
das Mortes.</p>

<p>We went over another domed mount, where
I found a spring of most delicious water emerging
in a gurgle from the very summit of the dome,
at an elevation of 2,400 ft. On all sides we had
beautiful domed prominences with wonderful grazing
land.</p>

<p>Alcides&mdash;careless, like all the others, with his rifle&mdash;was
nearly killed that day. His rifle went off accidentally,
and the bullet went right through the brim
of his hat, just grazing his forehead. But we were
accustomed to this sort of thing&mdash;it had happened so
often&mdash;and I began to wonder when bullets would
really wound or kill somebody. Indeed, we had a
guardian angel over us.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-352.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-352_th.jpg" alt="A Picturesque Waterfall on the S. Louren&ccedil;o River." title="A Picturesque Waterfall on the S. Louren&ccedil;o River." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">A Picturesque Waterfall on the S. Louren&ccedil;o River.</p>
<hr />
<p>We had descended into the belt of forest in the
depression (elev. 2,270 ft.), where a streamlet flowed
to the north-east into the Rio das Mortes. We were
travelling in a north-easterly direction, owing to the
formation of the country; but finding that it would
take me too much away from my intended course I
again altered our direction to a course due north. At
an elevation of 2,480 ft. we went over an extraordinary
natural bridge of solidified ashes and earth&mdash;a regular
tunnel&mdash;under which passed a streamlet of delicious
water&mdash;the Pulad&oacute; Stream. The river emerged some
distance off from under the tunnel. Curiously enough,
while the vegetation was quite dense both above and
below the natural bridge, there was no vegetation at
all along the hundred metres forming the width of the
bridge. Perhaps that was due to the lack of evapora<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-353" id="Pg_1-353"></a>[<a href="./images/1-353.png">353</a>]</span>tion
in that section, which supplied the trees elsewhere
with moisture.</p>

<p>We rode over many domes of an elevation of 2,550 ft.,
and then over some that were smaller in diameter
but of greater height. In the depressions between
we invariably found rows of <i>burity</i> palms amidst other
vegetation, and the characteristic heavily foliaged trees.</p>

<p>We encamped near a delicious spring of water on
the very summit of a dome. The water emerged from
a circular hole and was warm&mdash;so much so that the next
morning, when my Fahrenheit thermometer registered
an atmospheric temperature of 50&deg;, steam rose from
the water of the spring. Around the spring a curious
conical mound of white finely powdered matter resembling
kaolin had formed. This appeared to me to
have formerly been a small geyser. The cone was
broken on one side and the water did not come out
with great force. A few yards down the slope of the
dome another similar white cone was to be seen, with
a great mass of granular ash-pellets and tufa, such as
are commonly found near geysers or thermal springs.
We called that camp Cayambola.</p>

<p>On the night of June 12th the minimum temperature
was 50&deg; Fahr., the elevation 2,430 ft. The sky was
somewhat clouded, the clouds occupying four-tenths of
the heavens. At sunrise we observed radiations in the
sky&mdash;this time, curiously enough, from north-east to
south-west, instead of from east to west. The longest
and highest semicircle above us was in double filaments,
and resembled an immense fish-bone.</p>

<p>We were supposed to be then in a country infested
by cannibal Indians&mdash;swarms of them. My men were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-354" id="Pg_1-354"></a>[<a href="./images/1-354.png">354</a>]</span>
quite amusing in their fears. Four of them were
troublesome and insisted on the whole expedition
turning back in order to see them safely out of danger.
I remembered on those occasions an old Italian proverb
which said that to "women, lunatics, and children"
the wisest thing is always to say "Yes."</p>

<p>So when they threatened all kinds of things if we
did not return I generally answered that we would
continue a little farther, then we would see; and from
day to day this went on, making forced marches forward
all the time&mdash;generally of from 30 to 42 kil. daily. The
dissatisfaction among my men grew, nevertheless,
considerable, and a constant watch had to be kept over
them. Alcides and Filippe the negro showed great
courage, and, whatever other failings they may have
had, they invariably displayed extraordinary bravery
from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Alcides' principal faults were his great wastefulness
and violent temper and pride, which made it most
difficult to deal with him. He had been entrusted with
the commissariat, as with all my other occupations I
could not be bothered to sort out and weigh the food
for each man at each meal. Alcides would not understand
that it was unwise, in a country where absolutely
nothing was procurable, to throw away daily little
mountains of rice and beans and preserved meat, after
the men and our dogs had gorged themselves; and
that perhaps it would lead some day to our dying of
starvation. In confidence I had told him that we might
be several months&mdash;perhaps a year&mdash;before we should
be able to get fresh supplies. A little economy would
perhaps save us all from disaster. I wanted everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-355" id="Pg_1-355"></a>[<a href="./images/1-355.png">355</a>]</span>
to have ample food, but I did not see the use of throwing
away daily a larger quantity than the men actually
ate. It was true that we still had ample provisions of
all kinds for some eight months, but we must be prepared
for all emergencies.</p>

<p>Alcides, who was extremely obstinate, would not
hear of this. My remarks only made things worse.
The waste from that day doubled, and looking ahead
into the future it really broke my heart, as I well saw
that we should have hard times in front of us&mdash;all
because of the lack of common-sense on the part of my
followers.</p>

<p>On leaving camp we climbed to the summit of
another gigantic dome of green pasture land (elev.
2,500 ft.). We filled our lungs with the delicious air, slightly
stirred by a fresh northerly breeze. Geographically,
we were at a most important site, for it was from that
point that the division of waters took place between
those flowing eastward into the Araguaya and those
flowing westward into the Cuyab&aacute; River. So that
within a distance of a few kilometres we had visited
the region&mdash;the very heart of Brazil&mdash;from which the
waters parted to flow toward three different points of
the compass.</p>

<p>From that point we rose still higher to the summit
of a great table-land, absolutely flat and waterless for
over 30 kil. The soil was red in colour, with slippery
dried grass upon it and sparse, stunted vegetation.
The trees seldom reached a height of 5 ft. They were
mostly <i>gomarabia</i> or <i>goma arabica</i>&mdash;a sickly-looking
acacia; <i>passanto</i> with its huge leaves, <i>piqui</i> or <i>pequia</i>
(<i>Aspidosperma sessiliflorum</i> and <i>eburneum</i> Fr. All.), the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-356" id="Pg_1-356"></a>[<a href="./images/1-356.png">356</a>]</span>
fibrous <i>piteira</i> or <i>poteira</i> (<i>Fourcroya gigantea</i> Vent.),
and short <i>tocun</i> or <i>tucum</i> palms (<i>Astrocaryum tucuma</i>
M.). Occasionally one saw a <i>passanto</i> tree slightly
taller&mdash;perhaps some 10 to 12 ft. high&mdash;most an&aelig;mic-looking.</p>

<p>After having travelled some 24 kil. from our last
camp we came to a great expanse of <i>taquary</i>, a kind
of shrub 3 ft. high with spiky leaves of a wonderful
green colour.</p>

<p>We gazed upon the superb view of an enormous
plateau to the west with deep indentations in its
vertical sides. Huge spurs or rams of rock stretched
out across the deep depression, separating the plateau
to the west from the one on which we were standing.
Both plateaux were of equal height, and had evidently
at one time formed one immense flat surface. On our
side the plateau showed a huge slip of red volcanic
earth, with a lower stratum parallel to it of baked
brown rock. Under it were white lime and ashes, in
sections or drifts. In the centre of the valley formed
by the separation of the two sections there remained
a formidable crater&mdash;extinct, of course&mdash;with an arc-shaped
wall standing erect in its centre, and other
lower walls forming an elongated quadrangular channel
from south-east to north-west in the bottom of the
crater. Two conspicuous monoliths stood up behind
the huge lip of the crater to the south-west at the
bottom of the valley, and also other remnants of the
great convulsion of nature which had once taken place
there.</p>

<hr />
<p>Notwithstanding the constant annoyance of my
followers, I really enjoyed my journey over the central<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-357" id="Pg_1-357"></a>[<a href="./images/1-357.png">357</a>]</span>
plateau. The air was fresh and deliciously crisp and
clear. One could see for miles and miles and distinguish
the smallest detail in the far-away mountain sides, so
pure was the atmosphere. This scene was unlike any
in other countries. One could describe an entire circle
around oneself, and nowhere did the eye meet a column
of smoke rising above ground to indicate the presence
of man. Not a bird was to be seen or heard, not a
footprint upon the ground of any beast or creature of
any kind. The silence of that land was most impressive.
Our voices&mdash;as we spoke&mdash;sounded astonishingly and
abnormally sonorous, in that region which for thousands
of years had not been contaminated by sound. It
seemed as if the sound-waves, undisturbed by the
myriads of sounds which&mdash;as is well known&mdash;remain
floating in the atmosphere in inhabited countries, were
heard there in all their full and absolute purity. So
much were we all impressed by this fact&mdash;my men
unconsciously&mdash;that all the men began to sing, so
pleased they seemed with the powerful vibration of
their own voices.</p>

<p>To the north-west another lovely sight was before
us&mdash;another huge plateau in dim greyish blue&mdash;barring
the horizon. In front of it was one more table-land,
more broken up, and sloping on the south side.</p>

<p>When we reached the north-east edge of the plateau
we were travelling upon, we were treated to a fresh
marvellous scene. Straight in front of us, on the
opposite side of a deep depression&mdash;at 30&deg; bearings
magnetic&mdash;there stood one of the characteristic two-tiered
table-lands stretching from east to west. Below
us in the depression was an undulating line from north<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-358" id="Pg_1-358"></a>[<a href="./images/1-358.png">358</a>]</span>
to south of great bosses or domes of exquisite grassy
land, resting upon a kind of spur or peninsula jutting
out from our plateau&mdash;but at a lower elevation&mdash;of
which it formed part.</p>

<p>A formidable crack in the earth's surface extended
from north to south on the east of the chain of domes,
whereas to the east again of the giant crack was another
row of domed hills, forming&mdash;when taken as a mass&mdash;an
undulating terrace; then a vertical wall, above
which rested the sloping side of the plateau on which
we stood. It may be observed that the strata in the
split vertical wall on our side was absolutely horizontal.
On the summit of this rocky stratum lay a deposit,
30 ft. thick, composed of red earth and sand over yellow
sandstone and ashes, and, lower, grey ashes compressed
and consolidated. The lowest stratum visible
on the face of the wall was of bright red-baked rock.</p>

<p>The great depression, taken in its entirety, extended
from south-east to north-west. The huge crater was
to the south-east. To the south-west there was an
immense basin.</p>

Monoliths&mdash;The River Roncador&mdash;Gigantic Natural
Gateways&mdash;The Discovery of Fossils</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had reached the end of the comparatively flat
plateau, which varied in elevation on its summit from
2,530 ft. to 2,570 ft. above the sea level. We were
next faced by a most precipitous descent in order
to go down to the Jangada River&mdash;which eventually
flowed into the distant Rio Cuyaba. There was, of
course, no trail of any kind, and the course of the
descent before us was not unlike trying to take our
animals down the almost vertical wall of a fortress.
With picks and spades we cut a narrow path for a
short distance in order to start the reluctant beasts
down. I recommended the greatest care to my men,
but instead of following my instructions they drove the
rebellious quadrupeds with their whips in a heap along
the path&mdash;only a few inches wide&mdash;which we had cut.
Result: Collisions among the animals and against the
wall, and, next, five mules and baggage rolled down
the mountain-side at a vertiginous speed until they had
reached the bottom, some hundreds of feet below.
Antonio, the strong man of the party, who tried to go
to the rescue of one of the animals, was also dragged
down, and came within an ace of losing his life. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-360" id="Pg_1-360"></a>[<a href="./images/1-360.png">360</a>]</span>
was able to embrace a shrub with all his might just
before rolling over the precipice, and we rescued him.
We had to waste a great deal of time cutting an improvised
way in the mountain side. Then we had to
unload all the animals and convey the loads down on
men's heads. Each animal was then with great difficulty
and danger led by hand down to the stream.</p>

<p>Great quantities of beautiful marble and crystals
were met with, and masses of lava pellets and ferruginous
rock. In the Jangada valley we found two hot springs
emerging from the side of the plateau from which we
had descended. I discovered there two miserable tiny
sheds belonging to a family of escaped negro slaves.
They had lived seventeen years in that secluded spot.
They grew enough Indian corn to support them. All
the members of the family were pitifully deformed and
demented. Seldom have I seen such miserable-looking
specimens of humanity. One was demented to such
an extent that it was impossible to get out of him more
than a few disconnected groans. He spent most of
his time crouched like an animal, and hardly seemed
conscious of what took place round him. Another was
a deaf and dumb <i>cr&eacute;tin</i>; a third possessed a monstrous
hare-lip and a deformed jaw; while two women, dried
up and skinny, and a child were badly affected by
go&iuml;tre. For a single family that seemed a melancholy
spectacle.</p>

<p class="fsc">How Author's Animals rolled down Trailless Ravines.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was really pitiable&mdash;everywhere in the interior
of Brazil&mdash;wherever you came across a family, to find
that all its members were <i>cr&eacute;tins</i>, and deformed to such
an extent as to make them absolutely repulsive. Frequently
I had noticed among the common abnormalities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-361" id="Pg_1-361"></a>[<a href="./images/1-361.png">361</a>]</span>
supernumerary fingers and toes. One child at this
place, in fact, had six toes to each foot, besides being
an idiot, deaf and dumb, and affected by go&iuml;tre. The
only one of the family who was able to realize what took
place was terrified at our approach, and never got over
his terror as long as we remained. He suffered from
the illusion that everybody wished to murder him.
For some reason or other he believed that I had come
specially, all the way from my own country, in order
to search for him and kill him. All the most considerate
words on my part, the showering of presents,
had no effect upon him. He sat some way off, watching
me attentively all the time, and whenever I moved my
hands in any direction he dashed away shrieking,
thinking that I should attempt to strangle him&mdash;for
his mania was death by strangulation. After a while
he returned, and in his broken, almost unintelligible
language&mdash;his tongue was nearly paralyzed and he
had difficulty in articulating properly&mdash;begged to be
spared.</p>

<p>Those people lived worse than animals&mdash;in an
appallingly filthy condition, in two miserable, tumble-down
sheds, open on all sides, and not more than 8 ft.
high. They were reduced to that condition by intermarriage
among themselves; brothers with sisters&mdash;a
most frequent occurrence among the "civilized" of
Central Brazil&mdash;and even fathers with daughters and
sons with their mothers: a disgusting state of affairs
which could not very well be helped in a race and in a
climate where the animal qualities were extraordinarily
developed while the mental were almost entirely
deficient. Worse still, I had several cases under ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-362" id="Pg_1-362"></a>[<a href="./images/1-362.png">362</a>]</span>servation
in which the animal passions had not been
limited to closely related human beings, but extended
also to animals, principally dogs. The degeneration
of those people was indeed beyond all conception. It
was caused, first of all, by the effects of the most terrible
corruption of their blood, their subsequent impoverishment
of blood through intermarriage, the miserable
isolated existence which they led on scarce and bad food,
the exposure to all kinds of weather, and the absolute
lack of thought&mdash;almost paralyzing the brain power.
It was heart-rending to think that human beings could
possibly degenerate to so low a level, and&mdash;what was
worse&mdash;that beings of that kind were extraordinarily
prolific; so that, instead of being exterminated&mdash;which
would be a mercy for the country&mdash;they were in a
small way on the increase.</p>

<p>I camped near the sheds of that "happy family,"
having gone 42 kil. from the Rio das Mortes. I felt
sad the whole night, watching them unperceived. It
upset me so that I was ill for several days.</p>

<p>The Rio Jangada, at an altitude of 1,550 ft., was
1,000 ft. lower than the top of the plateau. The river
flowed west into the Cuyab&aacute; River. We crossed the
stream, a rapid and foaming torrent. We soon began to
climb again on the opposite side over sweeping undulations.
We waded through two more streamlets flowing
west&mdash;the second at an elevation of 1,650 ft. We were
travelling partly among campos on the summit of cones
and domes, partly through brush or scrub in the depressions.
We struggled on, urging the tired animals,
rising gradually to 2,150 ft., then to 2,200 ft., over soil
strewn with volcanic pebbles and scori&aelig;. During the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-363" id="Pg_1-363"></a>[<a href="./images/1-363.png">363</a>]</span>
night the minimum temperature had been 53&deg; Fahr.,
but during the day the sun was extremely hot and
powerful, and animals and men were sweating freely.
We marched northward, then slightly to the north-west,
leaving behind, to the south-west of us, two quadrangular
table-lands, rising above the undulating line of a
depression.</p>

<p>Shortly after, to the E.N.E., we perceived the
section of an extinct crater&mdash;the easterly point of its
summit being in itself a semicircular subsidiary crater.
On one side of the greater crater was a conical depression,
at the bottom of which (elev. 2,400 ft.) was
an extensive bed of lava blocks of great size&mdash;hundreds
of monolithic rocks standing up like pillars. In fact,
they stood all along the side of the crater as well as
inside it. Surrounding a pyramidal hill a group of
those huge pillars looked&mdash;to a casual observer&mdash;just
like the ruins of a tumble-down abbey.</p>

<p>Three hours' journey from our camp we reached the
summit of a dome (elev. 2,500 ft.). Beyond it was a
<i>cuvette</i> with its typical central line of <i>burity</i> palms.</p>

<p>To the west we perceived a marvellous view of three
immense dykes of red rock&mdash;like walls&mdash;stretching from
south-west to north-east; then two more great perpendicular
dykes of granite were disclosed close by.</p>

<p>Going over domes 2,550 ft. and 2,450 ft. above the
sea level, we obtained a vast and immense view of the
<i>serrad&atilde;o</i>&mdash;wild country&mdash;before us, a regular ocean of
deep green undulations rising quite high to the south;
whereas to the north there extended a long plateau with
a deep ravine on its southern aspect.</p>

<p>We descended through scrub (elev. 2,400 ft.)&mdash;what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-364" id="Pg_1-364"></a>[<a href="./images/1-364.png">364</a>]</span>
the Brazilians call <i>serrad&atilde;o</i>&mdash;and through a growth of
stunted trees (elev. 2,450 ft.) to so low an altitude as
2,300 ft. Going along a rocky cliff, we passed a strange
volcanic vent-hole with a pyramid of granite of large
proportions on each side of its aperture.</p>

<p>We arrived at the Roncador, a picturesque torrent
flowing over a bed of lava moulded in the strangest
possible shapes, hollows, terraces and grottoes. Most
peculiar were the great concave hollows, circular, oval,
and of irregular form, which were innumerable and of
all sizes along that extensive flow of lava.</p>

<p class="fsc">Hideous Types characteristic of Central Brazil.</p>
<p class="figcenter">Two women (left) and two men (right).</p>
<hr />
<p>We had travelled 30 kil. that day. That was such
a picturesque spot that I made camp on the right
bank of the torrent. We were all amazed to find an
immense block of rock&mdash;resembling in size and form
the Sphinx of Egypt&mdash;balanced to a nicety over the
edge of a conical rocky hill. It was, of course, the
work of nature. Why that rock remained there at all
and did not tumble down, was more than we could
understand. There was also a giant monolith and
other strange-looking rocks of great size standing up at
all angles close by. On climbing the hill where the
Sphinx-like rock stood, I discovered a circular crater
of great beauty, 300 metres in diameter. The western
wall of the crater had been knocked down, but on the
eastern inner side, in the central part 150 ft. high, there
was a precipitous fall, then a huge smooth inclined
plane of lava at an angle of 15&deg; overlapping the top,
where it had subsequently been subjected either to
violent earthquake shocks or other disturbing influences,
as it was badly seamed and fissured. Many
segments had crumbled down, leaving the remaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-365" id="Pg_1-365"></a>[<a href="./images/1-365.png">365</a>]</span>
portion of a most extraordinary shape. In the centre
of the crater there stood a huge mass of rock 150 ft.
high, which looked like an inclined table&mdash;a giant slab
cleanly cut at its angles, which protruded at great
length outside the base formed by broken-up blocks.
On looking west from the summit of the extinct volcano
one obtained a marvellous view of the vertical cliffs
between which the Roncador River flowed.</p>

<p>Then there was a great table-land extending from
north to south, composed of red volcanic rock and white
limestone. A separate red quadrangular castle-like
structure of immense proportions rose in the middle
foreground in the north-west upon a conical green grassy
base.</p>

<p>Add to this wonderful work of Nature a magnificent
sky of gold and brilliant vermilion, as limpid as limpid
could be, and you will perhaps imagine why I could not
move from the rock on which I sat gazing at that
magnificent, almost awe-inspiring, spectacle. Night
came on swiftly, as it always does in those latitudes,
and I scrambled down the hill, among the sharp, cutting,
slippery, shiny rocks, arriving in camp minus a good
many patches of skin upon my shins and knuckles.</p>

<p>At the point where I crossed the Roncador River
there were three handsome waterfalls in succession,
the central one in two terraces, some 90 ft. high. At
the foot of the two-tiered waterfall was a great circular
basin which had all the appearance of having been
formerly a volcanic vent. The flowing water, which
tumbled down with terrific force, had further washed
its periphery smooth. The centre of the basin was of
immense depth. Directly under the fall a spacious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-366" id="Pg_1-366"></a>[<a href="./images/1-366.png">366</a>]</span>
grotto was to be seen under a huge projecting
rock.</p>

<p>The elevation of the stream above the falls was
2,150 ft., below the falls 2,060 ft. The temperature of
the atmosphere was 72&deg; Fahr., and the minimum temperature
during the night 58&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>The Roncador flowed from north-east to south-west
as far as the foot of the great plateau we had observed
during our march. There, on meeting the great
vertical wall, its course was diverted in a northerly
direction and then again to the north-west, where the
stream eventually fell into the Cuyab&aacute; River. The
Rio Jangada, on which we had camped the previous
day, was a tributary of the Roncador, and so was the
streamlet called Pedra Grande, which entered the
Roncador on its right side. The Pedra Grande took
its name from an immense monolith, worn quite smooth,
near its bank.</p>

<p>From the Roncador we continued on our northerly
course. The western view of the "balanced Sphinx
boulder" was indeed remarkable. It seemed to stand
up on a small pivot despite all the laws of gravitation,
the heaviest side of the upper rock projecting far out
on one side with nothing to balance it on the other.</p>

<p>Cutting our way easily in the scrub, we rose to
2,300 ft. over a flow of red lava (it had flowed in an
easterly direction) in several successive strata. The
upper stratum was grooved into geometrical patterns,
such as we had met before, wherever it showed through
the thin layer of red volcanic sand which covered most
of it. We were there in a zone of immense natural
pillars of rock, some of such great height that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-367" id="Pg_1-367"></a>[<a href="./images/1-367.png">367</a>]</span>
were visible miles off along the range&mdash;which extended
from south to north, parallel, in fact, to the course
we were following.</p>

<p>Still proceeding due north, we arrived on the summit
of a great dome, 2,500 ft., from which point we had to
alter our course to the north-west, owing to an isolated
impassable barrier which we left on our right (north).
It had steep slopes but well-rounded terminal points.
It extended from N.N.E. to S.S.W., and had a height
of some 150 ft. above the flat <i>serrad&atilde;o</i>, on which my
skeleton-like mules wended their way among the
stunted trees, the bells dangling from their necks
monotonously tinkling&mdash;not the gay, brisk tinkling of
animals full of life, as when we had left Goyaz, but the
weak, mournful sound&mdash;ding ... ding ... ding&mdash;of
tired, worn-out beasts, stumbling along anyhow. Occasionally
one heard the crashing of broken branches
or of trees collapsing at the collision with the packs,
or the violent braying of the animals when stung in
sensitive parts by an extra-violent fly; otherwise there
was silence, the silence of death, all round us.</p>

<p>The poor brutes tore mouthfuls of grass, now on
one side then on the other, as they went along; but
the grazing was poor in the <i>serrad&atilde;o</i>, and the animals
found only enough to subsist upon. Two of them were
absolutely disabled, owing to accidents we had had;
and, with the animals I had lost, this involved loading
extra heavily those still able to carry. The
constant collisions against the stunted trees in that
trail-less region injured the animals considerably and
caused nasty sores and swellings all over their bodies.
I saw well that the poor beasts would not last much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-368" id="Pg_1-368"></a>[<a href="./images/1-368.png">368</a>]</span>
longer. It was impossible to halt a sufficient time to
let them recover in that particular region, with food
so scarce&mdash;it would have taken them months. In the
meantime our provisions were being fast consumed&mdash;or
rather wasted&mdash;and we had thousands of kilometres
to go yet. My men never suspected this, or they would
have never come on; but I knew only too well.</p>

<p>They still insisted on marching with their loaded
rifles, fully cocked, resting horizontally upon their
shoulders; and as we marched naturally in single file,
and as we used cordite cartridges with bullets of high
penetration, there was still a prospect of a bullet going
through one or more of us. Once or twice again a
rifle went off unexpectedly by accident. It would have
been terrible for any one of a nervous temperament
to be travelling with such companions. On previous
expeditions I had generally trusted in myself, but on
this particular one I was so disgusted that I had made
up my mind to trust in Providence alone. I did well,
for had I done otherwise I might have fared much worse
than I did.</p>

<p>We went over a pass (elev. 2,400 ft.) between two
small domes, quite barren but for a scanty growth of
short dried grass. We were marching over masses of
lava and conglomerate with innumerable marble pellets.
We found ourselves within a regular circle of low hills
enclosing a shallow depression. Subsequently we came
to a second and then to a third similar depression.</p>

<hr />
<p>Continuing in a north-westerly direction we again
obtained a gorgeous view of the treble <i>portal</i>&mdash;by which
word the Brazilians describe a monumental entrance of
any kind. That is just what those three immense gaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-369" id="Pg_1-369"></a>[<a href="./images/1-369.png">369</a>]</span>
in the plateau looked like: an immense wall of rock
forming a high barrier, with three gigantic natural
gateways.</p>

<p>After finding a stream of good water on the west
side of the plateau we rose again higher, obtaining a
splendid bird's-eye view of the picturesque depression
we had just crossed. The effects of erosion following
those of volcanic activity were evident enough upon
the entire landscape. On the west side we had a horseshoe-shaped
vertical wall&mdash;seemingly containing an
extinct crater&mdash;and yet another on the north side of
the western end of the elongated ellipse which was
there formed.</p>

<p>With some difficulty we managed to get the animals
up to the summit of the plateau (elev. 2,580 ft.). From
there we obtained a sumptuous view beyond. An
immense dyke of brilliant red rock, flat-topped, lay
majestically to the west. At its foot the Rio Pedra
Grande had its birth, and then flowed westward into
the Rio Roncador. Four gigantic flat table-lands stood
impressively in a line. Three more, equally impressive,
loomed in the south-west. Other minor ones, quite
wall-like&mdash;rectangular in vertical section&mdash;appeared in
the blue distance, while the horizon was barred by a
long flat plateau.</p>

<p>Looking north as we descended from the table-land,
we found on our left another extinct crater&mdash;semicircular
in shape, with several superimposed strata of
lava, each about one foot thick, capping its lip, which
was broken up into three sections. The valley below
that crater formed a <i>cuvette</i>, the bottom of which (elev.
2,200 ft.) showed deep erosion by water in one or two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-370" id="Pg_1-370"></a>[<a href="./images/1-370.png">370</a>]</span>
places. Sand covered the lava-flow which had travelled
northward. Quantities of heavy, spherical, bullet-like
blocks of hard-baked rock were scattered all about&mdash;evidently
shot out of the crater when active.</p>

<p>We had travelled 80 kil. from Cayambola in three
days, and we had reached a spot of slight, well-rounded
undulations where grazing was fair. I decided to halt
early in the afternoon&mdash;more particularly as this spot
appeared to me to have been at one time or other submerged&mdash;probably
it had been a lake bottom. I had,
since the beginning of my journey, been searching everywhere
for fossils&mdash;but in vain. I had not seen the
vestiges of a single one. Personally, I was persuaded
that Central Brazil could well be geologically classified
in the archaic group&mdash;the most ancient of the terrestrial
crust, and consisting (in Brazil) chiefly of gneiss, mica
schists and granite, solidified into their present form
by intense eruptive phenomena and dissolved&mdash;not by
immersion in ocean waters, as some suppose, but by
deluges of such potentiality as the human mind can
hardly conceive.</p>

<p>It was quite enough to visit the central plateau of
Brazil to be persuaded that that continent had never
been submerged under a sea; on the contrary, it must
have been the oven of the world. The volcanic activity
which must have taken place in that part of the world&mdash;it
was not a separate continent in those days&mdash;was
quite, as I have said, beyond human conception. This
does not mean that at later periods there may not have
been temporary lakes&mdash;as, for instance, in the spot
where we encamped that night&mdash;or portions of country
which had become flooded, upon the cooling of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-371" id="Pg_1-371"></a>[<a href="./images/1-371.png">371</a>]</span>
earth, and subsequently became drained and dry
again.</p>

<p>A wonderful surprise awaited me that day. To the
north of my camp was a peculiar round mound. I
climbed it, and what was my astonishment in the short
ascent to find near the summit, among a lot of lava
pellets, marble fragments, crystals, and great lumps
of iron ore, a number of vertebr&aelig; from the tail and
spine of a giant reptile! The vertebr&aelig; had been disjointed
and scattered somewhat about by wind and
water&mdash;but there they were; the smaller ones on the
side of the hill, the larger on the summit&mdash;which led
me to believe that the animal had crouched on the top
of the hill when dying. Some of the fossil vertebr&aelig;
were so large and heavy that I hardly had the strength
to lift them up. The bones&mdash;petrified&mdash;were of a
beautiful white. Many of them had, unfortunately,
become so fractured as to make identification difficult.
On following the line of the dorsal vertebr&aelig;&mdash;somewhat
scattered about&mdash;I came upon some vertebr&aelig; which
appeared to me to be cervical vertebr&aelig;; and then,
behold my joy! in searching around the summit of the
mound I perceived the skull. The skull was so big
and heavy that I could not carry it away, but I took
several photographs and careful drawings of it from
all sides.</p>

<p>It was curiously shaped&mdash;quite unlike any other
fossil skull I have seen. The cranial region proper was
extremely short, with smallish round orbits rather low
down on the side of the head. The skull had an
elongated shape: 35 cm. was its total length; 10 cm.
its maximum transverse breadth, and 5 cm. at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-372" id="Pg_1-372"></a>[<a href="./images/1-372.png">372</a>]</span>
central and widest part of palate. The skull itself,
with an elongated nasal bone, had a flattened point
almost like a beak, or more probably like the base of a
proboscis. The front part of the nose had unfortunately
become fractured and ended with a flattened segment.
A marked arch or hump stood prominent upon the
nasal bone. The temporal arcades were quite developed,
with prominent supra-orbital bosses. The
orbital hollows were 5&frac12; cm. in diameter, whereas the
external nares were 9&frac12; cm., the protrusion in front of
the nostrils being 10 cm. long. The palate, of great
length, had a peculiar complex shape, like a much-elongated
U with another smaller U attached to it in
the centre of its curve, <a href="./images/ill1-372.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-372_th.jpg" alt="Symbol." title="Symbol." /></a>.</p>

<p>The skull had been worn down by age and weathering.
Moreover, one side of the upper part of the cranium
had been entirely destroyed&mdash;seemingly by having
rested on red-hot lava. Many of the vertebr&aelig; were
equally injured. By even a superficial examination it
was easy to reconstruct the tragedy which had taken
place on that hillock thousands upon thousands of
years ago.</p>

<p>Searching about, I came upon another skull of a
huge reptile, and a number of smaller vertebr&aelig; than
those belonging to the animal above described. The
second skull was much flattened, of an elongated shape,
very broad, the orbital cavity being high up on the
skull&mdash;in fact, not unlike the skull of a great serpent.
It possessed a long occipital spur, extraordinarily
prominent, and fairly well-defined zygomatic arches&mdash;but
not quite so prominent as in the skull previously
discovered. Seen from underneath, there seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-373" id="Pg_1-373"></a>[<a href="./images/1-373.png">373</a>]</span>
be a circular cavity on the left front, as if it had contained
a large fang. This skull, too, was also much
damaged on one side, where it had rested on some
burning matter&mdash;evidently lava or lapilli. The skull
measured longitudinally 48 cm. and was 23 cm. broad.
Seen from underneath it resembled a much elongated
lozenge.</p>

<p>Although I searched a great deal I could not find
the lower mandibles of these two skulls, nor loose teeth&mdash;but
many indeed were the fossilized fragments of
bones of other animals strewn all over the hill-top. I
found up there quite a sufficient quantity to make the
summit of that hill look of a whitish colour. That was
why I had been attracted to it at first sight, and had
climbed it in order to discover why it was so white.
One immense bone&mdash;fractured&mdash;was the pelvis of the
larger animal. Nearly all those fossils were in terrible
preservation, much damaged by fire and water. Some
were so eroded as to be quite unidentifiable.</p>

<p>Most interesting of all to me were two smaller
skulls&mdash;one of a mammal not unlike a leopard or
jaguar, the other of an ape or perhaps a primitive human
being. The latter cranium, like all the others, had one
side completely destroyed by hot lava, which in this
instance had also filled up a considerable portion of
the brain-case. The human skull was small and under-developed,
no sutures showing; the forehead extremely
low and slanting, almost flattened, with the superciliary
region and glabella very prominent. One of the orbits
(the right) was badly damaged. The left, in perfect
preservation, was oval, very deep. The form of the
palate was of a broad U-shape&mdash;abnormally broad for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-374" id="Pg_1-374"></a>[<a href="./images/1-374.png">374</a>]</span>
the size of the head. The upper jaw was fairly high
and prominent, whereas the zygomatic arch on the left
(the right was destroyed) was not unduly prominent&mdash;in
fact, rather small and less projecting than the supra-orbital
region. Of the nasal bone only just a fragment
remained. The brain-case was small but well-rounded
at the back, where it had comparatively a fairly good
breadth behind the auditory meatus.</p>

<p>In my anxiety and enthusiasm, I used up, in photographing
the first skull I found, the only two photographic
plates which remained that day in the camera
I had brought with me up there. In order to obtain a
fuller view of the skull on the negatives I placed it on a
rudimentary stand I constructed with broken branches
of a tree. The sun had already set when I discovered
the two smaller skulls, and in any case I should not
have been able to photograph them that day. Well
recognizing their immense value, I enveloped them in
my coat, which I turned into a kind of sack by tying
the sleeves together, and, with a number of vertebr&aelig;
and a knee-joint I had collected, proceeded to carry the
entire load, weighing some sixty pounds, back to camp,
a mile away.</p>

<p>On my arrival there I met with a good deal of
derision from my ignorant men. I was faced with a
problem. Had I told the men the immense value of
those fossils, I feared they might be tempted to steal
them and sell them whenever we first reached a civilized
spot&mdash;which, true enough, might not be for many
months; a fact my men did not know and never for
one moment realized. If I did not tell them, I should
have to stand their silly derision as long as the journey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-375" id="Pg_1-375"></a>[<a href="./images/1-375.png">375</a>]</span>
should last&mdash;for they openly and loudly argued among
themselves the view that I had gone mad, and what
better proof could they have than my carrying a heavy
load of "ugly stones" as my personal baggage?</p>

<p>Of the two I came to the conclusion that derision
was better than being robbed. So I took no one into
my confidence. I merely stored the fossils carefully
away in a large leather case, meaning to take them
out some day to photograph them as a precaution in
case of loss. Unfortunately the opportunity never
offered itself, for we made forced marches every day,
from early morning until dark, and unpacking and
repacking were very inconvenient&mdash;each package having
loops of rope fastened round, in order to be readily
attached to the saddles, which took much time and
trouble to undo. Then the ridicule of my men each
time the "ugly stones" were referred to also kept me
at first from unduly attracting their attention to them.
With the many things I had to occupy my time day and
night I ended by forgetting to take the photographs&mdash;greatly
owing to being almost certain that I should
bring the skulls themselves safely back to Europe.
But the unexpected always happens. We shall see
later on how&mdash;after having carried those fossils safely
for several months&mdash;they were, unknown to me, wilfully
flung, together with a quantity of provisions, into a
deep part of the Arinos River by my companions, and
they were beyond recovery.</p>

<p>Greatly to my regret, we left that interesting spot
the next morning. A drenching rain prevented my
paying a second visit to the two hillocks where the fossil
fragments were to be found, but I took the exact position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-376" id="Pg_1-376"></a>[<a href="./images/1-376.png">376</a>]</span>
of them, so that any further expedition could locate the
spot with great ease.</p>

<p>It was interesting to note that a Brazilian expedition
had discovered some fossil bones of a gigantic
animal some 200 kil. south-west of that place, and other
remains of a giant animal had been found by another
Brazilian expedition on the banks of the Paranatinga
River, some 400 or 500 kil. north-east of our position.</p>

<p>We were encamped on the bank of the Rio Pedra
Grande&mdash;the stream of that name which we had
passed that day being merely a tributary. During
the night we had observed a double-ringed lunar halo.
The moon was almost full. From the horizon directly
under the moon were innumerable radiations, not converging
toward the moon but, curiously enough, the first
two at a tangent to the larger halo, the others at
equal intervals on each side.</p>

<p>At sunrise, before the rain-storm began, we were
treated to wonderful cloud and light effects. The
lower portion of the sky, of brilliant yellow and vivid
green, was surmounted by golden and red streaks of
wonderful vividness. Later, over the great natural
gateways, the sky formed itself into concentric arches
of blazing yellow and red, rendered intensely luminous
by contrast with the heavy black clouds which were
fast collecting overhead. No sooner was the sun well
above the horizon than we came in for a heavy downpour.</p>

Virgin Country&mdash;Beautiful Rapids</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> leaving camp (June 15th) I noticed that the hills
on which I had found the fossils formed a semicircle
to the west. Rising quickly to an elevation of 2,070 ft.,
we were in sight of two great table-lands which
stood to the west. In crossing the river I found a
number of other fossils, among which was one that
appeared to be the petrified foot of an animal of
enormous proportions.</p>

<p>We soon crossed the little stream Lazinha, which
flowed into the Pedra Grande. As we travelled over
two ridges (altitude 2,100 ft. and 2,130 ft.) separating
deep basins, and the weather cleared a little, the view
before us of the entire line of natural gateways, with
two additional pyramidal and prismatic peaks to the
south, became more and more beautiful. There was
a strong breeze blowing from the north-east. At an
elevation of 2,150 ft. we found quantities of marble
chips and blocks and great masses of ferruginous,
froth-like rock.</p>

<p>As we went along we obtained an imposing view to
the north of an immense plateau in three terraces, the
lower one appearing like the sea&mdash;it was so blue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-378" id="Pg_1-378"></a>[<a href="./images/1-378.png">378</a>]</span>&mdash;with
the brilliant red upper portion rising out of it
like a great island. The foreground of dark green, in
great undulations, stood out in contrast to the light
green of the slopes of the plateau on the top of which
we were marching.</p>

<p>Central Brazil was certainly a country of flat sky-lines&mdash;so
flat that often when the distance became
of a pure cobalt blue one had the impression of overlooking
an immense ocean, to which the green undulations
in sweeping lines in the nearer foreground added
the impression of great waves.</p>

<p>It was indeed difficult to realize the stupendous
magnitude of the scenes we constantly had before us.
That day, for instance, the plateau to the north of
us stretched across towards the east for 70&deg; of the
compass from bearings magnetic 320&deg; (N.N.W.) to 30&deg;
(N.N.E.). Above the plateau was a strange effect
of clouds&mdash;a succession of arrow-shaped, nebulous
masses.</p>

<p>We still came upon basins of grey ashes&mdash;<i>cuvettes</i>&mdash;but
in that region these were deeper than those we
had observed so far, had luxuriant grass, and in the
moist centre the invariable line of <i>burity</i> palm and
heavily foliaged trees.</p>

<p>Travelling on a northerly course, and then to the
north-west, we descended, after having marched 20 kil.,
into a basin (elev. 1,950 ft.) where a thick and wide
deposit of fine white sand and minute crystals covered
the deeper part of the depression. Then, farther on,
the sand was replaced by the usual deposits of grey
ashes which filled the remainder of the basin. A streamlet
which had its birth in the centre of the basin flowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-379" id="Pg_1-379"></a>[<a href="./images/1-379.png">379</a>]</span>
north into the Rio Manso, along one of the many
cracks which were to be seen in that region and in the
depressions we had previously crossed. We came upon
a mighty flow of red and black lava with a somewhat
frothy surface. It was in superposed layers from one
to six inches deep, with an inclination to the east of 15&deg;.
The flow itself had a direction from west to east.</p>

<p>As we were marching by compass, with no trail
whatever, we found ourselves entangled in a swampy
valley with tall reeds, from which we had some difficulty
in extricating ourselves. We eventually had to
retrace our steps for six kilometres in order to find an
easier way for our animals. After an examination of
the country with my telescope from a high spot, I
decided to go westward across a flat swampy plain of
ashes, sand and water&mdash;most troublesome for the mules
and horses. They sank deep into the soft ground and
frequently rolled over, damaging saddles and baggage.
One or two of my men had involuntary baths when the
animals' knees gave way under them.</p>

<p>As soon as we had emerged from that wearisome
marsh the animals and men were so tired&mdash;although
we had only gone 22 kil. from our last camp, without
counting the deviation (28 kil. with deviation)&mdash;that
I had to encamp on the bank of the streamlet Fascin&aacute;,
coming from the west. There we had the laborious task
of spreading to dry all the articles that had got wet&mdash;including
my bedding, tent, and a quantity of my
clothing, which was not packed like all the rest in air- and
water-tight cases.</p>

<p>The stream Fascin&aacute; flowed into the Rio Furnas and
eventually into the Rio Manso to the north&mdash;the latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-380" id="Pg_1-380"></a>[<a href="./images/1-380.png">380</a>]</span>
a tributary of the Cuyab&aacute; River. That region had
been rich in Mangabeira (the <i>Hancornia speciosa</i> M.)&mdash;a
wild lactiferous plant of much value, producing a
fruit called the <i>mangaba</i>.</p>

<p>June 16th. Minimum temperature 54&deg; Fahr.; elevation
1,940 ft. On leaving camp, after a good deal of
trouble in recovering our animals in the morning, as
they had strayed in all directions, we found ourselves
travelling along the edge of a large grassy basin (elev.
2,000 ft.) extending from south-east to north-west,
with a wonderful growth of <i>burity</i> palms; then upon
a second basin (elev. 2,100 ft.) with deep deposits of
ashes. We climbed higher, to 2,150 ft., where we found
a third oval <i>cuvette</i> with a surface layer of ashes&mdash;merely
a continuation of the preceding <i>cuvette</i>. We
here resumed our northerly course, going through what
the Brazilians call <i>chapada</i>, or high land scantily
wooded.</p>

<p>To the south-west we had a high plateau with
round natural towers of red rock, resembling the walls
of a fortress. Those red cylindrical towers stood all
along the summit of the range&mdash;with immense square
blocks of grey rock above them in horizontal strata.
In the centre of that long range could be perceived
a double-tiered crater and several grottoes. In its
northern section the range was vertical, with red and
yellow rocky walls over 300 ft. high. On the summit
of that rocky stratum were other strata with a dip to
the south. Half way up could be observed a red
ledge about 10 ft. thick (also with a dip to the south)
all along the entire length of the range. Colossal
blocks and flows of lava were to be seen 300 yards east<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-381" id="Pg_1-381"></a>[<a href="./images/1-381.png">381</a>]</span>
of this range. In one place was an immense natural
arch&mdash;like the work of a skilful mason. At the northern
end of the range stood a castle&mdash;the work of nature&mdash;with
three square towers, and between them numerous
monoliths or pillars standing on walls of columnar
formation.</p>

<p>Evidently there was a crater in that northern part,
the castle-like structure being merely formed by many
superposed layers of yellow lava. Near the throat of
the crater the lava was hard baked and of a bluish
red colour. In the lower section the strata were each
6 ft. thick, under a smooth band, absolutely horizontal,
100 ft. in thickness. There were then two top layers,
each 20 ft. thick, and four more layers each 4 ft. thick,
and slightly wavy. The last ones were somewhat
shattered, and displayed large blocks moved out of
position&mdash;apparently by a volcanic explosion.</p>

<p>In going round the northern corner of the range
more similar buttresses, like towers, were disclosed&mdash;I
could count as many as eight&mdash;projecting out of the
immense vertical block of rock. Those buttresses were
of brown and bright yellow rock. The range had a
general direction from south-east to north-west.</p>

<p>Great deposits of white sand and ashes were noticeable
on the surface. In cuts and in the bed of a
streamlet were strata of consolidated ashes in distinct
layers one inch thick. The foot of the gigantic rocky
mass was at an elevation of 1,700 ft. We were on a
slanting plane forming a conical basin in continuation
of the crater. To the north, where the basin opened,
was a great stretch of cobalt blue in the distance,
which looked just like a glimpse of the ocean. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-382" id="Pg_1-382"></a>[<a href="./images/1-382.png">382</a>]</span>
it was not; it was the far-away plateau we had seen
for some days.</p>

<p>We were now entering a region of the most impressive
and weird scenery I had ever seen, except,
indeed, in the Himalaya Mountains. Directly in front
of us towered the Morro Plum&atilde;o, a most striking
giant block of rock several hundred feet high, standing
quite alone, and resembling a church surmounting
a medi&aelig;val castle&mdash;not unlike St. Michael's Mount,
only with land around instead of water. Even quite
close to it the illusion was perfect. This wonderful
natural structure of dark red rock was in perfectly
horizontal strata, each 10 ft. thick, separated and
clearly defined by whitish lines, which aided to give
the illusion of a wonderful work of masonry.</p>

<p>"Church-rock," as I called it&mdash;or "Spray-rock"
(<i>Plum&atilde;o</i>), as my men named it&mdash;stood majestically in
solitary grandeur in the middle of a great subsidence
of the soil. That great subsidence was in turn bordered
by immense vertical cliffs of the same rock of which
"Church-rock" was formed. Indeed, it was clear that
the soil had given way, leaving only that great rock
standing. Even my men&mdash;for the first time since they
had been with me&mdash;were deeply impressed by that
wonderful spectacle; so much so that they all took off
their hats, as Brazilians always do in passing churches.</p>

<p>We traversed the great depression, which gave us
irrefutable evidence of what had taken place in that
zone. The great rocky, plateau-like mountain to our
left had split and fallen over on the north side,
describing an arc of a circle of 90&deg;. In fact, as we went
along, in places where the rock under foot was exposed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-383" id="Pg_1-383"></a>[<a href="./images/1-383.png">383</a>]</span>
we were treading over laminated rock, the stratification
of which was vertical, and corresponded exactly to that
of the upstanding wall where the stratification was
horizontal.</p>

<p>Behind "Church-rock" to the north-west was a
massive plateau, beyond which stretched an immense
undulating depression with two outstretching spurs
from south-west to north-east upon it. "Church-rock"
was 26 kil. from our last camp.</p>

<p>On the north side of "Church-rock," close to the
conical hill upon which the giant quadrangle of rock
rested, was a hump formed by huge blocks, the top
one&mdash;a colossal one&mdash;just balanced, as if it might
tumble over at any moment. Then on the side could
be seen a lava-flow and huge masses of lava which had
been shot up with great force and curled over, retaining
the frothy appearance of its former state of ebullition.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, even when seen from the side
and from behind (N.N.W. view), "Church-rock" retained
all the semblance of a castle and church perched
up on that high pinnacle. From the N.N.W., besides
the castellated towers which surmounted all, there
appeared a perfect representation of a gabled roof over
the body of the church, as well as the flying buttresses of
the walls. Behind was a great cylindrical annexe with
a semi-spherical superstructure, such as is often to be
seen behind Roman Catholic churches. The illusion
was really wonderful.</p>

<p>Owing to the pools of water not far from "Church-rock"
we called that spot <i>Caponga de la Lag&otilde;a</i>.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards beyond "Church-rock" we
came upon another extraordinary sight: a quad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-384" id="Pg_1-384"></a>[<a href="./images/1-384.png">384</a>]</span>rangular
rocky castle&mdash;a perfect cube of rock&mdash;which
stood at a considerable elevation upon a conical base,
some distance off the wall-like sides of the plateau.
Strangely enough, a thin wall of rock, only a few feet
thick, quite vertical, of great height and of great length,
joined this quadrangular castle to the plateau. That
wall had evidently remained standing when the plateau
had subsided. The larger plateau along the foot of
which we travelled ended in two great domes, one at
each angle of its eastern terminus wall. The eastern
part of that plateau was flat-topped, whereas the central
portion rose into a double pyramid and looked not
unlike a giant tent with a porch attachment. It was
of a bright yellow colour&mdash;apparently sandstone and
ashes. The work of erosion had been greater on the
eastern face&mdash;owing, I think, to the prevalent wind on
that side.</p>

<p>On looking back upon the great range of rock
which ended abruptly near "Church-rock" (which,
as we have seen, once formed part of it), a great semicircular
cavity was disclosed on its western face. The
summit of the wall around the cavity rested on an
inclined plane, which in its turn rested above a vertical
concave wall. The latter wall of rock had conical buttresses
at the terminal points.</p>

<p>West-north-west of the great wall was an immense
depression. Only a conical hill rose above its last
undulations. The upper edge of that depression was
at an altitude of 1,550 ft. above the sea level, whereas
the top of "Church-rock" was fully a thousand feet
higher&mdash;viz. 2,550 ft.</p>

<p class="figcenter">(Side view.)</p>
<hr />
<p>At the terminus of the first section of the cliff range,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-385" id="Pg_1-385"></a>[<a href="./images/1-385.png">385</a>]</span>
interrupted by a great fissure from the second section,
another structure in course of formation not unlike
"Church-rock" could be observed. It had a quadrangular
tower surmounting it. There was in the
second section of the range a regular quadrangle of
rock, with a high tower upon a conical hill, and another
castle-like structure surmounting a conical base. The
two were most impressive as they stood in their sombre
red against the brilliantly blue sky.</p>

<p>Next to the second section of the range, to the
north, was a high mountain of two twin-pointed peaks,
shaped like a badly-pitched tent. Then came another
plateau, much eroded on its south side. Beyond was
an immense black plateau on three successive tiers&mdash;and
this one, unlike the others of which it was merely
a continuation, had sloping instead of vertical sides.</p>

<p>We had a nasty experience that day, which for the
moment made us forget the beauty of that wonderful
scenery. We were going through high scrub and stunted
trees and tall grass, much dried by the intense heat&mdash;quite
suffocating in the basin with the refraction from
the huge rocks. A strong breeze sprang up, and we
were delighted&mdash;when we saw, fast approaching, a
dense black and white cloud rolling, as it were, along
the ground. As it got nearer there were such loud
crackling and explosions that it seemed like the volleys
of musketry in a battle. My horses and mules pricked
up their ears, lifting their heads high&mdash;sniffing, neighing,
and braying. They became restless. Before we had
time to realize what was the matter, we saw tongues
of flames shoot out from the earth. Within a few
seconds, with the wind which was blowing high, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-386" id="Pg_1-386"></a>[<a href="./images/1-386.png">386</a>]</span>
found ourselves with a barrier of fire close upon us
behind and fast gaining upon us. The trees seemed
to flare up in a moment like matches or fireworks. A
wave of terrific heat took our breath away. We were
almost suffocated. There was only one way of escape&mdash;in
front of us. For to the left we had the impassable
barrier of rock; to the right the flames had already
gained on us in a semicircle like a claw of fire. We
stirred on our animals, lashing them. My men, with
their heads wrapped to prevent suffocation from the
stifling smoke, were in a great state of excitement.
They were about to abandon the animals in order to
save their own lives; but Alcides, Filippe, and I kept
the rear, endeavouring to save men, baggage, and
animals. The flames gained on us very quickly. They
occasionally almost licked our animals. The mules
and horses, now fully enveloped in dense, choking
smoke, began to stampede, and soon all the animals
were galloping away, sniffing, neighing and braying
frantically. In their disorderly flight they crashed
against trees and tore off branches; stumbled over
rocks and rolled over themselves; struggling up on
their feet only to resume their mad race for life.</p>

<p>For some little time it was all we could do to keep
a few yards in front of the flames, the heat of which
was roasting our backs and necks. At last, in a desperate
effort, we managed to get slightly ahead, and
when we descended&mdash;some of the animals rolled down&mdash;into
a deep depression, we found ourselves clear of the
smoke. The wind was unfortunately blowing the way
we were travelling, but in that depression we were
sheltered, and the fire would not travel so fast. Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-387" id="Pg_1-387"></a>[<a href="./images/1-387.png">387</a>]</span>
eyes were smarting terribly and we were coughing
violently, our parched throats and lungs, filled with
the pungent smoke, giving us a feeling of nausea.
When we had reached a point of comparative safety we
had to readjust all the loads on the pack-saddles, which
had almost come undone. It was a wonder to me that
in the precipitous flight we had lost nothing.</p>

<p>We had unavoidably deviated several kilometres
from our course, as the animals were beyond guiding
under those circumstances. Eventually, after a considerable
detour in order to avoid the flames, we went
over several undulations&mdash;especially a peninsula-like
spine of rock rising over a great depression, then between
two twin mountains. We emerged on the bank
of the Rio Manso, flowing northward on a pebbly bed.
We crossed it where it was one hundred metres wide,
but only 2 to 3 ft. deep. There was a thick growth of
vegetation&mdash;a belt some hundred yards wide&mdash;on both
banks of the river. The Rio Manso was there at an
altitude above the sea level of 1,150 ft.</p>

<p>I took observations for longitude, and latitude by
double altitudes at that place. (Lat. 13&deg; 53&#8242; S; Long.
55&deg; 13&#8242; W.) I had to halt there one day in order to give
the animals a rest, after the long and reckless march of
the previous day&mdash;a distance of 42 kil.</p>

<p>The source of the Rio Manso was to the E.S.E. some
120 kil. from the place where we crossed it. Where we
encamped it received a small streamlet, flowing over a
bed of laminated igneous rock and several successive
strata of slate, which in some places were in a vertical
position, in others at an angle of 40&deg;. I noticed this
vertical foliation and these laminated strata all over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-388" id="Pg_1-388"></a>[<a href="./images/1-388.png">388</a>]</span>
the great depression we had crossed in order to reach
the Rio Manso.</p>

<p>The Rio Manso, which flowed into the Cuyaba
River, was not to be confounded with the Rio Manso
forming the head-waters of the Rio das Mortes, which
eventually threw itself into the River Araguaya.</p>

<p>Owing to one of my animals having strayed away
and the difficulty of finding it again in the tall grass
and high vegetation, we were not able to leave camp
until the afternoon of June 18th. Soon after starting
on the march we went through a marvellous arch of
thick foliage, creepers, bamboos, and <i>akur&iacute;</i> palms,
previous to crossing a streamlet 9 metres wide and 1 ft.
deep&mdash;flowing towards the west. We had no end of
trouble near these streamlets, as they flowed between
precipitous banks 50 to 70 ft. high. There was no trail.
The animals frequently lost their footing over the
slippery, steep slope, and rolled down, baggage and all,
until they reached the bottom; or else they would
sometimes stick half way down against trees and liane,
and we had the greatest difficulty in extricating them
again.</p>

<p class="fsc">Quadrangular Rocky Mountain connected by Natural Wall of Rock with the Vertical-sided Range in Background.</p>
<hr />
<p>There was a low range extending from north to
south along the left bank of the Rio Manso. From a
hill 1,470 ft. high above the sea level on the right bank
of the river we saw a plateau in four terraces&mdash;the third
of the line of plateaux we had seen on our preceding
march. Upon getting higher we perceived to the south,
beyond the four-terraced plateau, another plateau with
vertical walls, and to the south-west a high double-humped
dome&mdash;resembling Mount Vesuvius in Italy.
Evidently one more of the innumerable extinct volcanoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-389" id="Pg_1-389"></a>[<a href="./images/1-389.png">389</a>]</span>
to be seen in that region. The mountainous mass
extended in a more confused form farther to the south-west.
On our side of the Rio Manso the country was
gently undulating&mdash;in fact, it formed many parallel
ridges of low, well-rounded hills with occasional deep
hollows or basins between. One could not help being
particularly struck by the wonderful regularity and
strong similarity of the curves on the parallel hill ranges,
as if all had been turned out of the same mould. The
hill-range we were on was 1,500 ft. above the sea level.
The others&mdash;excepting one or two&mdash;were lower.</p>

<p>There was an absolutely flat horizon line to the
north, with no mountain range in sight. The country
opening up before us was from that point almost
entirely made up of campos, with <i>chapada</i> or growths
of trees principally near streams in the valleys. We
crossed a watercourse 30 metres wide and 1 ft. deep
at an elevation of 1,350 ft. We called it the Palmeira,
owing to the many palms upon its banks. Here grew
many great <i>caja</i> or <i>cajazeiro</i> trees (of the genus Anacardiace&aelig;),
the largest and tallest trees I had yet seen in
Brazil, and <i>Garappa</i> or <i>Garabu</i> (of the genus Terebinthace&aelig;)
trees&mdash;very interesting on account of their
peculiar winged roots. They resembled the <i>nonoko</i>,
which were characteristic of the Polynesian Islands and
Philippine Archipelago, only the Brazilian ones never
attained proportions so large.</p>

<p>With endless trouble we had gone 20 kil. We had
come to streams, where again, owing to the precipitous
descents on the slippery high banks, several
mules fell over and rolled down into the stream. One
mule, particularly, had become very nervous on ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-390" id="Pg_1-390"></a>[<a href="./images/1-390.png">390</a>]</span>proaching
those places. Foreseeing the punishment
which would be meted out, its knees invariably began
to tremble and give way, and it let itself roll down purposely,
every time we came to those difficult passages.
Once down at the bottom, with baggage often immersed
deep in water, we had the greatest difficulty in making
the wretched animal get up again, and we frequently
had to drag it bodily up the opposite slope by means of
ropes. I have never seen an animal stand more beating
than that brute did. Although I am most kind to
animals, I must say for my men that this particular
mule often drove us all to absolute despair. Dragging
the dead weight of an animal up a steep slope, 40, 50,
or even 70 ft. high&mdash;we were only seven men&mdash;was no
joke at all. When you had to repeat the operation
several times a day, it was somewhat trying. Once
the brute had been dragged up to the top it would
quickly get up on its legs, and marched well while on
fairly good ground. But in moments of danger it was
one of the most pusillanimous animals I have ever
possessed.</p>

<p>I had given strict orders that in places of that kind
the more timid animals were to be unloaded, and the
loads conveyed across on men's backs. My orders
were always disobeyed. The result generally was that
not only did the men have to carry the loads eventually,
but we had to carry the animals as well. Endless time
and energy were thus wasted. That is what happens
to people who try to save themselves trouble.</p>

<p>At sundown, after having witnessed a glorious view
of the valley to the north, we descended rapidly amidst
luxuriant vegetation of tall bamboos, <i>akur&iacute;</i> palms, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-391" id="Pg_1-391"></a>[<a href="./images/1-391.png">391</a>]</span>
festooned liane, until we reached the Palmeira River,
flowing from north to south. Having crossed it, we
continued for 3&frac12; kil. through dense vegetation, and
then recrossed it at a spot where it passed within
enormous fissures in colossal masses of highly polished
yellow lava. After solidification these masses of lava
had been subjected to violent commotion, as their
stratification was nearly in a vertical position.</p>

<p>Wherever possible I took observations for latitude
and longitude, in order to ascertain my exact position;
an 8-in. sextant, mercurial artificial horizon and
chronometers being used for the purpose. It is not
easy to describe the torture I had to go through when
taking those tedious astronomical observations. The
glass roof of the artificial horizon had unfortunately
got broken. I had to use a great deal of ingenuity in
order to screen the mercury from the wind so as to
obtain a well-defined reflection. No sooner was I
getting a perfect contact of the sun's image and its
reflection than some huge fly or other insect would begin
to promenade on the mercury, disturbing its surface.
Butterflies were even more troublesome, as they left
upon the mercury&mdash;by the luminosity of which they
were greatly attracted&mdash;sediments of multi-coloured
powder and down from their wings and bodies. The
mercury had to be carefully re-filtered before work
could proceed. Then, what was worse, when both
your hands were occupied&mdash;one holding the sextant,
the other gently screwing the vernier&mdash;hundreds of
mosquitoes, taking advantage of your helpless condition,
buzzed round and settled on your nose, ears, neck,
eyelids and forehead, stinging you for all they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-392" id="Pg_1-392"></a>[<a href="./images/1-392.png">392</a>]</span>
worth. Swarms of bees&mdash;a dwarf kind, with body in
yellow and black stripes; fortunately these did not
sting&mdash;also placidly roamed upon every available patch
of skin with a provoking tickling. A great number of
them settled along the edges of the eyelids, attracted
by the sheen of the retina of the eye, into which they
gazed with great interest. Others, more inquisitive,
would explore the inside of your ears; while millions&mdash;actually
millions&mdash;of <i>pium</i>, the tiny gnats&mdash;more
impertinent than all the others taken together&mdash;dashed
with great force up your nose, into your eyes, into your
mouth, and far into your ears, and were most troublesome
to remove. Your ankles and knees and wherever
the skin was soft were itching terribly with <i>carrapatinhos</i>,
and before you got through with your work you were
also swarming all over with ants of all sizes&mdash;careering
all over your body and inflicting painful bites whenever
you placed your hand upon your clothes to arrest their
progress. When you had endured the torture long
enough, and had managed to take a satisfactory solar
observation, you generally had to remove all your
clothes in order to get rid of the unpleasant parasites&mdash;and
you then had a good hour's hard work cut out
for you.</p>

<hr />
<p>We continued our march northward, the temperature
in the sun being 105&deg; Fahr. The minimum
temperature had been 60&deg; Fahr. during the night of
June 17th, and 64&deg; on June 18th. We crossed the Piraputanga
River, flowing into the Rio Manso, and then
passed over a magnificent flow of yellow, red and
black lava, the Cambayuvah River, a tributary of the
Palmeira.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-393" id="Pg_1-393"></a>[<a href="./images/1-393.png">393</a>]</span>
The Cambayuvah flowed through a great volcanic
crack 75 ft. high, the sides of the crack showing much-fissured
strata in a vertical position. A smaller
streamlet entered the Cambayuvah where we crossed it.
Wonderfully beautiful, indeed, were the rapids among
brilliantly coloured red and yellow rocks, the water
winding its way among high upstanding pillars and
sharp blades of laminated rock.</p>

<p>A beautiful waterfall tumbled over with a great
noise into a pool, scooped out of an immense block
of such hardened rock that even the force of that violent
stream seemed to have had but little erosive effect
upon it. The edges of it were as sharp as possible,
instead of being worn smooth and rounded by the
constant rapid flow of water. The rock had been hard
baked, and was of a shiny black colour, almost as shiny
as crystal. At the bottom of those picturesque rapids
was a circular volcanic vent, the periphery of which
had been blackened by the action of fire. The Cambayuvah
followed a general course of south-east to
north-west.</p>

<p>We camped near that enchanting spot&mdash;most
picturesque, but terrible for my animals, as the grazing
was poor. My mules, when let free at the end of the
march, stood helpless around the camp, looking reproachfully
at us, and making no effort to go far afield
in order to get something to eat. The poor things were
quite exhausted. I saw well that they could not last
much longer. My men were constantly worrying me,
and saying that we were going to sure perdition. They
had become painfully home-sick, and had they not
been dead-tired too&mdash;more so, perhaps, than the mules<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-394" id="Pg_1-394"></a>[<a href="./images/1-394.png">394</a>]</span>
and horses&mdash;I should have expected great trouble from
them. As it was, to lead on those men with persuasion
and kindness was an exhausting mental effort for me.
Once or twice the suggestion was made that if I did
not agree to go back the way we had come I might
perhaps get killed and they would return alone. When
I enquired whether any of them could find their way
back alone, they said "no"; so I suggested that perhaps
it would be to their advantage to let me live. I
might eventually see them out of that difficulty.</p>

<p>In all my travels I have seldom come across men
more helpless at finding their way about, or realizing
in which direction they had travelled. Barring Alcides,
none of them had any more idea whether we had
travelled south, north, east, or west of Goyaz, than
the man in the moon. Naturally I did not exert myself
to enlighten them unduly, for there lay my great and
only hold over them. I had fully realized that I was
travelling with an itinerant lunatic asylum, and I
treated my men accordingly. No matter what they
did or said, I always managed to have things my own
way. Never by violence, or by a persuasive flow of
language&mdash;the means used by the average mortal. No,
indeed; but by mere gentleness and kindness; very
often by absolute silence. Few people realize the force
of silence on momentous occasions; but of course few
people know how to remain silently silent&mdash;if I may
so express it&mdash;in moments when their life is seriously
at stake. Silence is indeed the greatest force a man
can use, if he knows how to use it. It is certainly
invaluable in exploring, when naturally one is not
always thrown into contact with the best of people.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-395" id="Pg_1-395"></a>[<a href="./images/1-395.png">395</a>]</span>
The animals strayed away during the night, and
it took all the best part of four hours to recover them
in the morning. Instinct is a wonderful thing. They
had all travelled to a place where, over undulating
country, fairly open campos, slightly wooded with
stunted trees, were to be found, and where they could
obtain something to eat. When we crossed those campos
after our departure from camp, foliated rock showed
through the surface soil in many spots, in strata either
displaced and left vertical&mdash;in many cases at an angle
of 38&deg;&mdash;or in its original horizontal plane. Elsewhere
dips in all kinds of directions showed that there must
have been a good deal of commotion in that region
when that part of the country subsided and formed the
basin we were then crossing. The typical feature of
all those undulations was their arched backs.</p>

<p>We were at a low elevation&mdash;only 1,300 ft. above
the sea level. We were travelling over immense quantities
of marble pebbles and volcanic d&eacute;bris. We there
made the acquaintance of the <i>gramadin</i>, a plant with
curved spikes, which seldom attained a height of more
than one inch above the ground. It was terribly
poisonous if touched.</p>

<p>We went over three successive ridges (elev. 1,300 ft.).
On the summit of each ridge we found a profusion of
marble d&eacute;bris and even large blocks immaculately
white or else yellow&mdash;probably rendered of the
latter colour by contact with iron, plentiful in that
region.</p>

<p>On the summit of the sixth ridge (elev. 1,330 ft.),
that day, we came upon large sheets of foliated rock&mdash;again
almost absolutely vertical in its stratification<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-396" id="Pg_1-396"></a>[<a href="./images/1-396.png">396</a>]</span>&mdash;and
great masses of thin slate plates or foliations extending
from east to west.</p>

<p>Farther on, from a high point, 1,450 ft. above the
sea level, we could gaze once more upon a gorgeous
panoramic view of the marvellous scenery we had left
behind&mdash;the great plateaux of rock as red as fire, and
"Church-rock" looming high against the sky. We
kept on rising upon various undulations&mdash;that day's
march was one of continuous ascents and descents.
At 1,600 ft. we found more masses of vertically foliated
slate, ashes consolidated into easily-friable sheets, and
large quantities of beautiful marble.</p>

<p>To the north and north-east we had delightful
scenery, the <i>pao d'arco</i> trees in full bloom, of a reddish-purple
colour, adding greatly to the vivid colour-scheme
of that view, with its cobalt blue of the distant mountains
and the Veronese green of the campos in the foreground.
Nearly all the ridges we had crossed which
extended from north-east to south-west were well
rounded&mdash;fairly well padded with sediments of earth,
sand and ashes.</p>

<p class="fsc">Campos and Chapada of Matto Grosso.</p>
<hr />
<p>We descended to 1,300 ft. (above the sea level)
through thin forest, in a valley where bamboo was
abundant as well as <i>gamelleira</i> trees with their winged
roots of great size. The <i>gamelleira</i> was somewhat
larger than the <i>garappa</i> or <i>garabu</i>. We found in that
valley a beautiful grove of <i>akur&iacute;</i> palms, the palms being
10 to 15 ft. high. In going through&mdash;cutting our way
with <i>falcons</i>&mdash;long heavy-bladed knives specially made
for cutting through forests&mdash;we were much worried by
spiders' webs of great size, from which we had trouble
in extricating our heads and hands as we went along.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-397" id="Pg_1-397"></a>[<a href="./images/1-397.png">397</a>]</span>
There were thousands of those webs at the entrance of
the forest, and we dragged them all along on our
passage. With their viscous properties they clung to
us, and we could only shake them off with difficulty.</p>

<p>Most interesting of all was the <i>cepa d'agua</i>&mdash;a powerful
liana, four inches in diameter, festooned from the
highest branches of trees, and which when cut ejected
most delicious cool water. Then there was a tree called
by the Brazilians "<i>mulher pobre</i>," or "poor woman's
tree"&mdash;do you know why?&mdash;because from its juice it
was possible to make soap, which saved the expense of
buying it. There was a roundabout way of reasoning
for you.</p>

<p>Eighteen kilometres from our last camp we came to
a rapid streamlet of the most limpid water, the Rio
Mazagan (elev. 1,300 ft. above the sea level), four metres
wide and four inches deep. When we drank it it nearly
made us ill, so foul was its taste of sulphur and lead.
The treacherous stream flowed into the Cuyab&aacute; River.</p>

<p>There were many <i>tamburi</i> trees of great proportions,
handsome trees with clean, healthy white bark and
minute leaves&mdash;at the summit of the tree only. In the
forest, although the taller trees were generally far apart,
none of them had branches or leaves lower than 30 to
40 ft. from the ground. The <i>angico</i> or <i>angicu</i> (<i>Piptadenia
rigida</i> Benth.), which was quite plentiful, was
also a good-looking tree of appreciable height and
circumference.</p>

<p>Upon emerging from the beautiful forest, quite clear
underneath with only a few ferns, we crossed great
campos&mdash;"<i>campina grande</i>," as my Brazilians called
them. Skirting the forest in a northerly direction, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-398" id="Pg_1-398"></a>[<a href="./images/1-398.png">398</a>]</span>
went over a low hill range with delightful clear campos
and patches of forest. We crossed another streamlet
of foul-tasting water&mdash;with a strong flavour apparently
of lead.</p>

<p>In the great undulating valley we left behind&mdash;as
we now altered our course slightly to the north-west&mdash;was
prominent a double-humped hill which rose higher
than any other except in the north-west portion of the
landscape. There a high chain of hills could be seen.</p>

<p>When we crossed over the second ridge (elev.
1,400 ft.), strewn with yellow lava pellets, at the end
of extensive campos we obtained an imposing view to
the north. An elevated flat-topped table-land of great
magnitude rose in front of us&mdash;a perfectly straight line
against the sky, but terminating abruptly with three
gigantic steps, with a subsidiary one upon the second
step, at its western end. This plateau stood out, a
brilliant mass of cobalt blue with great projecting spurs,
like a half-section of a cone surmounted by a semi-cylindrical
tower along the southern wall of the plateau.
Then a strange hill mass of four distinct composite
domed heights with minor peaks stood between the
plateau and us&mdash;and extended, like most of the other
ranges, from south-east to north-west.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had gone 96 kil. in four days' marching since leaving
the Rio Manso. We were only a few kilometres from
the Serra Azul, or Blue Mountains&mdash;truly mountains
of the most vivid and purest cobalt blue I had ever
seen&mdash;quite a wonderful spectacle.</p>

<p>We made our camp in a prairie with good grazing
for our animals. Although we were at a comparatively
low elevation&mdash;1,150 ft. above the sea level&mdash;the minimum
temperature of the atmosphere was 56&deg; Fahr.
during the night.</p>

<p>On leaving camp&mdash;still proceeding north&mdash;we descended
to 1,100 ft. into a lovely stretch of magnificent
grass with a lagoon. The level of the water was low,
as we were then at the end of the dry season. On the
flat grassy land were curious semi-spherical mounds,
4 to 6 metres in diameter and from 2 to 6 ft. high. On
each of these mounds were a few stunted trees. No
trees whatever existed except upon these small mounds,
the explanation being, I think, that the mounds had
formed around the trees while these were growing, and
not that the trees had grown upon the mounds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-400" id="Pg_1-400"></a>[<a href="./images/1-400.png">400</a>]</span>
As we were getting nearer, the Serra Azul to the
north was most impressive. I think that it was partly
due to the bluish foliage of the vegetation upon it that
the range, even close by, appeared of so vivid a blue,
and also to the deep blue shadows cast by the spurs
which projected, some to the south-east, others due
south&mdash;that is, it will be understood, on the southern
face of the range.</p>

<p>Thick deposits of cinders lay in the valley. On
approaching an intermediate and lower range we cut
our way through scrub&mdash;chiefly of <i>sciadera</i> trees, seldom
growing to a greater height than 7 ft. The domed hills
showed through the grass great blocks of volcanic rock,
while at the foot of the hills could be noticed huge
boulders of consolidated ashes with veins of crystals
and marble. There, too, the stratification was vertical.
There was lamination in some of the rock, but not in
the granite blocks nor in the blocks of marble, which
appeared to have been subjected to enormous heat.
Some of the rock had been in a state of absolute
ebullition.</p>

<hr />
<p>At the spot where we crossed the range&mdash;starting
our ascent from an elevation of 1,100 ft.&mdash;were immense
holes, vents and cracks in the earth's crust. As we
rose slightly higher among many chains of low hills,
we were upon a horizontal stratum of laminated granite.
Higher still we passed a semicircular hill composed of
immense blocks of granite. In the centre of the semicircle
was a great round hole, 30 ft. in diameter&mdash;an
extinct crater. Farther on, ascending upon an inclined
plane, we came to another similar semicircle&mdash;not of
rock that time, but of red earth and cinders. When we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-401" id="Pg_1-401"></a>[<a href="./images/1-401.png">401</a>]</span>
reached the highest point (elev. 1,270 ft.) of the divide
we had to our left huge pinnacles and pillars of rock
of the most fantastic shapes, monoliths from 10 to 15 ft.
high, and rocks hollowed by the action of fire. Big
boulders, which had become perfectly rounded by having
been shot through the air and revolved at a great speed
while in a half-solid condition, were to be seen scattered
all over the inclined planes of the saddle of the divide.
Giant cacti grew in abundance in the interstices between
rocks. Although most of the rocks were blackened
outside, by chipping off the outer surface one found
that they contained inside beautiful white marble or
else greyish granite. The latter was striated with thin
layers&mdash;not more than a quarter or half an inch thick&mdash;of
crystallized matter, forming veins in the blocks or
dividing two strata.</p>

<p>Everywhere could be noticed remarkable perforations
of all sizes in the rocks, great spherical or ovoid
hollows, or cylindrical tubular channels. In the ground
were many volcanic vents with lips baked by fire.</p>

<p>On our right, a kilometre or so farther on, after
having gone through an extensive stretch of red sand
and lapilli, we came across three hills, the central one
of which had the appearance of a cylindrical tower of
masonry with windows and doors. It was a wonderful
freak of nature. Under this huge tower were several
caves and grottoes.</p>

<p>Descending upon the opposite side of the range, at
an elevation of 1,200 ft. we found the dry bed of a
streamlet, which flowed in a northerly direction when it
did flow at all. On emerging from the wide hill mass&mdash;about
18 kil. across&mdash;we found ourselves among a lot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-402" id="Pg_1-402"></a>[<a href="./images/1-402.png">402</a>]</span>
of <i>burity</i> palms on the western spur of the Serra Azul.
When we were actually upon them, the Blue Mountains
lost their blue appearance and were more of a greyish
green, owing to the vegetation which covered most of
their slopes. The range was formed of three distinct
terraces, the lower one being of greater height than the
two upper ones. A number of low hill ranges starting
from the main range branched off like spurs towards
the south. The uppermost terrace of the main range
was supported on a high vertical wall of red rock.</p>

<p>On meeting the Rio Coralzinho we skirted it for
some distance through the forest, then marched among
a great many domes, small and large; after which we
crossed a wonderful field of huge monoliths, superposed
boulders, and rocks of all kinds of fantastic shapes.</p>

<p>We had marched 30 kil. that day. We encamped
on the River Piraputangas&mdash;a tributary on the left side
of the Cuyab&aacute; Grande River&mdash;the Cuyab&aacute; Grande
being in its turn a tributary on the right of the Cuyab&aacute;
River.</p>

<p>The Cuyab&aacute; River described almost an arc of a
circle&mdash;in fact, quite a semicircle&mdash;its birth taking place
in the Serra Azul. Where we crossed it we were only
a short distance to the west from its point of origin.</p>

<p>Where we had made our camp we were in a large
grassy plain about six kilometres long and nearly two
kilometres wide. The rainy season was fast approaching.
We came in for a regular downpour during
the night, accompanied by high wind, which knocked
down all our tents, as the pegs would not hold in the
soft, moist ground. We had a busy time endeavouring
to protect the baggage. We all were absolutely soaked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-403" id="Pg_1-403"></a>[<a href="./images/1-403.png">403</a>]</span>
The minimum temperature was 52&deg; Fahr. In the
morning, after the wind had abated and the rain had
stopped, we were enveloped in thick fog.</p>

<p>We had descended to so low an altitude as 750 ft.
above the sea level on the north side of the Serra
Azul&mdash;the lowest elevation we had been at for some
considerable time. We had descended altogether from
the highest part of the great Central Brazilian plateau.
From that point all the waters would be flowing to
the north-east or north. We were, in fact, within a
stone's throw&mdash;to be more accurate, within the radius
of a few kilometres&mdash;of the birthplace of the Rio
Novo, the head-waters of the River Arinos, of the
Rio Verde (Green River), and of the several sources
of the Rio S. Manoel or das Tres Barras, or Paranatinga;
and not distant from the sources of the great
Xingu River.</p>

<p>The Serra Azul, extending from west to east, was
interesting geographically, not only because it marked
the northern terminus of the highest terrace of the
great central plateau, but also because from it or near
it rose two of the greatest rivers of Central Brazil&mdash;the
Xingu and the Arinos (Tapajoz), the latter the
most central and important river of Brazil, crossing
the entire Republic from south to north, as far as the
Amazon.</p>

<p>On June 21st we crossed the Piraputangas (elev.
750 ft. above the sea level), where, owing to the steep
banks, we had much difficulty in taking mules and
baggage to the opposite side. We then proceeded
across another large plain, skirting the spurs of the
Serra Azul. Nine kilometres from camp we came to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-404" id="Pg_1-404"></a>[<a href="./images/1-404.png">404</a>]</span>
stream 80 metres wide, which flowed from north-east
to south-west. It had an average depth of 1&frac12; ft. It
was, I think, the Cuyab&aacute; Grande.</p>

<p>It was not easy to identify those rivers, as the
existing maps of that country were absolutely worthless,
most of them being filled in with fancy mountains
and rivers, which either did not exist at all or were
sometimes hundreds of kilometres out of their position.
There were frequently mistakes of two, three, and
more degrees in the latitudes and longitudes even of
important places. As for the tributary rivers, of which
merely the mouths were known and named, they had
supplied good material for the imagination of more
or less artistic cartographers in order to fill in the
rest of their course. Even the German map and the
American maps of the International Bureau of American
Republics, which were the two best, were extremely
inaccurate in their representation of that region. For
instance, the latter map&mdash;and nearly all the other
maps&mdash;placed the Serra Azul some 180 or 200 kil.
south of its actual position. The German map was
some 70 kil. out. The Serra Azul could be seen from
a great distance, and had been marked approximately
and not by actual observations on the spot. Nor, of
course, had the tributaries of the Cuyab&aacute; been explored
or even seen except at their mouths; hence their
imaginary courses.</p>

<hr />
<p>Considering how the maps of those regions had
been got together, it was really wonderful that, with
all their blunders, they gave as much information as
they did. Unhappy, nevertheless, would be the poor
traveller who relied on those maps in making a journey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-405" id="Pg_1-405"></a>[<a href="./images/1-405.png">405</a>]</span>
across the country. For instance, if you expected to
come upon a certain river in one day and did not get
there until after ten or fifteen days' hard marching;
if you expected to find a mountain range&mdash;nearly as
high as the Himalayas or at least as high as the Andes,
according to the deep shading on the maps&mdash;and found
instead an interminable flat plain; and if you saw on
your map rivers marked navigable, and found rapids
instead, in comparison with which the terrible ones of
Niagara are mere child's play, you would certainly
become rather sceptical of prettily-drawn maps.</p>

<p>On most of the maps of Brazil one saw marked to
the east of the Araguaya, in the Goyaz Province, an
immense range with no less a name than Cordilheira
Geral la Serra do Estrondo&mdash;or "General Range of the
Mountains of Noise." They were marked as the most
prominent range in Brazil&mdash;quite as high as the Andes
of Peru, Bolivia, and Chili; whereas, as a matter of
fact, I was told on good authority that they were mere
low hills, where there were any hills at all.</p>

<p>To come to great geographical mistakes which
came under my direct observation, I found a very
palpable one in the head-waters of the Cuyab&aacute; River,
which had their source to the north of the Serra Azul
and not to the south, as marked on many maps, including
the Brazilian official maps.</p>

<p>We had to our left the Serra das Pedra&mdash;"Range
of Rocks"&mdash;an extraordinarily rocky range, which was
crossed almost at right angles by the Chapad&atilde;o das
Porcas. We marched through a wonderful growth of
palmeiras, some of the palms being as much as 30 ft.
high. <i>Buritys</i> were innumerable along a small stream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-406" id="Pg_1-406"></a>[<a href="./images/1-406.png">406</a>]</span>&mdash;the
Rio Estivado&mdash;flowing south-west into the
Cubay&aacute; River. There were great quantities of <i>mangabeira</i>
trees. We proceeded northward along a <i>chapada</i>&mdash;a
capital Brazilian name which denotes a locality
that is neither a forest nor a prairie. The <i>chapada</i>
had scanty trees and scrub, but not enough to make
it into a forest.</p>

<p>We were marching over low hills with surface deposits
of sand and cinders. We gradually reached an elevation
of 1,050 ft. some 18 kil. from camp, and shortly
after&mdash;and only 50 ft. lower&mdash;entered a refreshing
grove of giant <i>palmeiras</i> and <i>buritys</i> along the Rio das
Porcas, flowing westward. There, north of the stream,
we went across more clean campos, 1,700 metres wide,
bounded to the north by the thickly-wooded hill-range
Keboh, extending before us from east to west.</p>

<p>We crossed this range in the centre, during a strong
gale from the south-west. The wind cleared the sky,
that had been overcast and had made the atmosphere
heavy. Again that afternoon, when the wind ceased,
I noticed the peculiar striations in the sky&mdash;not in
straight lines that time, but in great and most regular
curves converging to the west.</p>

<p>The valley got narrower as we went along. Two
twin conical hills ended the northern extremity of the
range (south-east to north-west) which we had on our
left&mdash;a great mass of granite blocks in the centre of
the plain rising higher and higher into regular domes.
The plain itself, on an incline, showed two swellings of
great magnitude, the one to our right about 120 ft.
higher than the plain, the elevation of which was
1,000 ft. On the west side of those two swellings was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-407" id="Pg_1-407"></a>[<a href="./images/1-407.png">407</a>]</span>
a confused mass of huge blocks of granite&mdash;of all sizes
and shapes&mdash;which to all appearances had been shot
up from underneath by some internal force. They
were outwardly much blackened by the action of fire,
but internally were of a grey tint. A little farther we
were encircled by basaltic columns of great height,
many of them fractured, forming a fantastic sky-line.
Some resembled the spires of a cathedral;
groups of others had the appearance of the ruins of
an ancient fortress; others stood up like giant obelisks;
while accumulations of others formed more or less
regular pyramids.</p>

<p>After leaving that strange basin, we were once more
travelling across patches of clean <i>chapada</i> and dirty
<i>chapada</i>&mdash;according to the soil and quantity of moisture;
then over arid campos spreading for 15 kil. without
one single drop of water.</p>

<p>At sundown, after having gone over several undulations
varying from 850 to 900 ft. above the sea
level, we went over a hill slightly higher&mdash;950 ft.&mdash;with
a summit of ashes, red earth, and yellow lava pellets,
as well as great sheets of foliated lava.</p>

<p>Under a most wonderful effect of light to the west&mdash;three
superposed horizontal bands of luminous
yellow, violet and brilliant vermilion, over the deep
cobalt mountain range in the distance&mdash;we arrived,
my men being thirsty and tired, at a little rivulet. We
had marched 42 kil. that day.</p>

<p>My men felt the cold intensely during the night&mdash;the
minimum temperature was 48&deg; Fahr., with a high,
cutting wind. Yet we were at a low elevation, merely
750 ft. above the sea level. There were, as usual,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-408" id="Pg_1-408"></a>[<a href="./images/1-408.png">408</a>]</span>
moans and groans all night, more toothache and
rheumatic pains and bones aching in the morning. The
discontent among my men had reached a trying point.
They worried me continuously to such an extent&mdash;indeed,
as never in my life I had been worried before&mdash;that
I was within an ace of breaking my vow of never
losing my patience and calm. In my long experience
of exploring I have always had to deal with the most
troublesome types of men imaginable, but never with
any quite so unpleasant as those I had in Brazil.</p>

<p>When, the next morning, I ordered them to pack
the animals in order to proceed on our journey, there
was an unpleasant scene approaching mutiny. They
knocked things about and refused to go on. Then
they sat, rifles in hand, a little way off, grumbling and
grunting, with vicious expressions upon their faces.
They were going to do wonderful things&mdash;they were
indeed! I overheard them. One man came forward&mdash;the
spokesman. The men claimed their money up
to date since the last payment made to them&mdash;only a
fortnight before. They all wished to go.</p>

<p>"Certainly," was my immediate reply. Without a
moment's hesitation they were each handed over their
full pay, and without giving the slightest attention
to them, Alcides, who had remained faithful, and I&mdash;poor
Filippe had been dragged against himself into
the plot&mdash;collected all the animals and packed them.
Without one look or word&mdash;as if they had not existed&mdash;I
started off the troop of animals and got on my saddle
to depart last. With the corner of my eye I kept a
watch on them&mdash;as with men of that kind the chief
danger was when you had your back turned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-409" id="Pg_1-409"></a>[<a href="./images/1-409.png">409</a>]</span>
I had gone only a few yards when I heard some one
sobbing behind my mule. As I turned round, the two
outstretched hands of Filippe were handing me back
the sum of money I had paid a few moments before.
He was begging me to keep it safely for him. Then
two more hands urged me to take back for safe
keeping the wages they had just received. The faces
of the owners of those hands were too comic for words:
the cheeks shining with abundant tears that streamed
down, the eyes red and swollen, the mouths stretched
in nervous strain from ear to ear. Behind came two
more men, looking as mournful as if they were being
led to execution.</p>

<p>They all begged to be re-employed. I let them
follow&mdash;on foot&mdash;for several kilometres without saying
a word&mdash;struggling through the heavy marching painfully
and wading across chest-deep in the streams.
We crossed the Riber&atilde;o Chabo or Guebo, 25 metres wide
and 3 ft. deep, at an elevation of 730 ft., then shortly
after we waded through another stream flowing south,
with a zone of wonderful <i>palmeiras</i> along its banks.
We then emerged into a magnificent plain with a
barrier of low hills to the north-west. Six kilometres
farther we waded across the Planch&atilde;o stream, 5 metres
wide and 6 in. deep. Marching on horseback was delightful,
the maximum temperature being only 74&deg; Fahr. in
the shade. Another stream, flowing from north to south,
the Planch&atilde;onzinho, whose foul water was quite disgusting
to drink, although beautifully limpid, was then
negotiated.</p>

<p>I was delighted at meeting with so many streams, for
there was nothing my men hated more than to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-410" id="Pg_1-410"></a>[<a href="./images/1-410.png">410</a>]</span>
into the water. They felt very sorry for themselves,
to be struggling along as best they could, following the
animals like humble sheep instead of being comfortably
mounted on quadrupeds. We travelled a considerable
distance through campos, but owing to some baggage
which had been lost we eventually had to retrace our
steps as far as the Planch&atilde;onzinho River, on the banks
of which we encamped. This was unfortunate, as the
water had a sickening flavour and made even our coffee
and tea taste like poison.</p>

<p>Misfortunes never come alone. In overhauling my
baggage I discovered, to my dismay, that my men&mdash;in
order to force me to go back the way we had come&mdash;had
gradually thrown away most of the provisions, which
should have lasted us some six to seven months longer.
We had only sufficient food to last us a few days. The
men confessed their misdeed. The country provided
absolutely nothing to eat, and I had to face the problem
of either dying of starvation or falling back on some
place where we could purchase fresh provisions. It
was out of the question&mdash;unless one wished to commit
suicide and a quintuple murder&mdash;to endeavour to push
on towards my goal, Manaos on the Amazon, some
1,600 kil. distant as the crow flies, or at least 4,000
to 5,000 kil. travelling, with possible deviations,
without some of which it was not possible to
travel. We could certainly not fall back on our point
of departure, the terminus of the railway at Araguary,
1,596 kil. distant; nor on Goyaz, the last city we had
seen, 1,116 kil. away&mdash;so that the only way to escape
death was to fall back on the ancient settlement of
Diamantino, the farthest village in Central Brazil, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-411" id="Pg_1-411"></a>[<a href="./images/1-411.png">411</a>]</span>
place once established by the first Portuguese settlers
of Brazil while in search of diamonds.</p>

<p>Diamantino was practically in the very centre of
the thicker part of South America, without counting
Patagonia. It was almost equidistant&mdash;roughly speaking,
some 2,560 kil. as the crow flies&mdash;from Pernambuco
on the Atlantic Coast to the east, Callao (Lima) in
Peru on the Pacific Coast to the west, Georgetown in
British Guyana to the north, and Buenos Ayres in the
Argentine Republic. Although so far in the interior
and almost inaccessible from the north, east, and west,
Diamantino could be reached comparatively easily
from the south, travelling by river up the Parana,
Paraguay, and the Cuyab&aacute; Rivers, as far as Rosario&mdash;thence
by trail to Diamantino. I had heard that the
place was once flourishing, but had since become almost
totally abandoned. I thought that perhaps I might
be able to purchase sufficient provisions to get along;
and&mdash;hope being one of my everlasting good qualities&mdash;I
also dreamt that perhaps I might there get fresh men.</p>

<p>It was indeed with a bleeding heart&mdash;when I had
reached a point some 200 kil. north of the Serra Azul&mdash;that
I had to alter my course, which had been practically
due north, into a south-westerly direction, and endeavour
to find Diamantino. My men were delighted at the
prospect of seeing human beings again. We had met
no one for some weeks. We made terrific marches daily
in order to reach that village before the food gave out
altogether.</p>

<p>The nights were cold&mdash;47&deg; Fahr. being the minimum
at our camp on June 23rd.</p>

<p>We crossed a small range of hills over a pass 930 ft.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-412" id="Pg_1-412"></a>[<a href="./images/1-412.png">412</a>]</span>
above the sea level, and found ourselves in a spacious
<i>cuvette</i> with the usual central line of <i>buritys</i> and thick
vegetation (elev. 900 ft.). Soaring over our heads were
a number of <i>gavi&atilde;o caboclo</i> (<i>Hetorospidias meridionalis</i>),
a kind of falcon, rending the air with their unmusical
shrieks.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill1-412a.jpg"><img src="./images/ill1-412a_th.jpg" alt="Matto-Grosso Girl, a Mixture of Portuguese, Indian and Negro Blood." title="Matto-Grosso Girl, a Mixture of Portuguese, Indian and Negro Blood." /></a></p>

<p class="fsc">Brazilian Child, a Mixture of Portuguese and Negro.</p>
<hr />
<p>After leaving the <i>cuvette</i> we began to ascend the
Estivado Range, very steep and rocky. Near the
summit we struggled through a field of great igneous
boulders, chiefly upright pillars of granite and white
marble. Upon the pass (elev. 1,400 ft.) was a circular
depression some 300 metres in diameter, perfectly flat-bottomed
and grassy. It was surrounded by cones from
80 to 100 ft. high. On the south-east side of the range&mdash;very
steep&mdash;was abundant rock, whereas to the
north-west side was a padding of brown earth on a
gentle incline divided into terraces. Here and there
pointed noses of volcanic blocks, similar to those we
had found on the opposite side of the range, showed
through. We went across a depression where water
dripping down the mountain-side had remained stagnant,
rendering that spot almost impassable. The animals
sank chest-deep into slush, crashing through the thick
and much-entangled growth of live and fallen bamboos.</p>

<p>More campos, fairly wide, were found beyond this,
and great stretches of foliated slate and sandstone in
strata turned over into a vertical position, and quantities
of d&eacute;bris. Then again we cut our way through a cool
growth of bamboos, handsome <i>palmeiras</i> and <i>akuri</i> palms;
after which we emerged into campos once more, rising
gradually to an elevation of 1,550 ft. upon an undulating
terrace of the second section of the Estivado range.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-413" id="Pg_1-413"></a>[<a href="./images/1-413.png">413</a>]</span>
Pulling and pushing the mules and horses over a lot
of boulders and up a steep incline, we reached the
highest point of the range on our route&mdash;1,800 ft. above
the sea level. Again the stratification of red and grey
rock in layers from 6 ins. to 1 ft. thick, standing
vertically, showed what a geological commotion there
must have been in those regions. The summit of the
range, extending from north to south, appeared like
the teeth of a saw, so broken up was it into repeated
undulations. On the west side of the range we found a
gentle slope of clear campos with merely a few stunted
trees upon them.</p>

<p>Before us to the west stood high the level sky-line
of a table-land, showing perfectly straight parallel strata
of rock extending all along its face, but slightly undulated
near the summit of the range. Otherwise its grassy slopes
were quite undisturbed in their virgin smoothness.</p>

<p>In the distance to the north of our course was a
great lagoon&mdash;the Lag&otilde;a dos Veados, "Lagoon of the
Deer"&mdash;a most important point in South America, for
it was there that the great Arinos (Tapajoz) River rose.
The lagoon&mdash;3 kil. long and less than 1 kil. wide&mdash;had
no visible outlet, but some hundreds of metres away a
spring came out of the earth, forming the Rio Preto
(Black River). The Rio Preto, soon joined by the Rio
Novo which we had seen descending from the Serra
Azul, formed the Arinos River and could certainly be
considered the head-waters of that immense tributary
of the Amazon.</p>

<p>A short distance south of Diamantino were the
Sete Lagoas, or Seven Lakes&mdash;as a matter of fact, they
numbered more than seven&mdash;circular pools only a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-414" id="Pg_1-414"></a>[<a href="./images/1-414.png">414</a>]</span>
few yards in diameter but extraordinarily deep, evidently
of volcanic origin, and filled with water at a
later time. Around their edges a remarkably luxuriant
growth of <i>buritys</i> could be admired. A great valley
extending south with a central ridge could be distinguished.
On it was the meeting-place of the Rio
Diamantino and the Rio do Ouro (River of Gold),
which, with the Sete Lagoas, formed another most
important point of South America, for it was there that
the Great Paraguay or Parana River rose.</p>

<p>It was thus interesting to note that within almost
a stone's throw rose two of the most powerful rivers of
South America&mdash;one flowing due north into the Amazon,
the other almost due south as far as Buenos Ayres
and Montevideo, where it entered the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>A great confusion is made on most maps between
those lagoons and the actual birth-places of those important
streams. The ancient Jesuits and friars had
a fair idea of geography. I have in my possession a
remarkable work in Italian published in Rome in 1698
by Father John Joseph of S. Teresa&mdash;a barefooted
Carmelite. It is entitled <i>The History of the Wars in
the Kingdom of Brazil between the Crown of Portugal and
the Republic of Holland</i>. The book contains a number
of extraordinary maps of Brazil. Those of the principal
harbours give a splendid idea of the places represented.
The coastline of the continent is indicated with fair
accuracy. It is curious to note that the author of that
book and the cartographer place the sources of the
Amazon and of the River Plate in the same spot, as
descending on opposite sides of a range extending from
east to west&mdash;a range which does not exist, unless it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-415" id="Pg_1-415"></a>[<a href="./images/1-415.png">415</a>]</span>
intended to represent the Central Brazilian plateau.
"The River S. Francisco," Father John Joseph goes
on to state, "has also its birth in the spot where the
Amazon is born, but this is not sure." The cartographer,
in fact, places the head-waters of that river
close to the head-waters of the Amazon, and makes them
flow through a large lagoon in the heart of Brazil&mdash;evidently
the Great "Lag&otilde;a dos Veados" or else the
"Sete Lagoas" to which reference has previously been
made in this chapter. "The Rio Grande (Rio Parana,
Paraguay), one of the most celebrated in Brazil,"
proceeds the Carmelite Father, "is born already swollen
by plentiful waters (<i>sic</i>) in the interior of terra firma!
Near its sources it forms a lagoon 20 leagues in circumference."
All this is, of course, geographically
wrong. The Rio S. Francisco has its birth far to the
south-east in Minas Geraes, some hundreds of kilometres
distant from that lagoon and several thousand from the
real source of the Amazon.</p>

<p>Also the friar must have mistaken&mdash;evidently from
information received&mdash;the sources of the Arinos
for the sources of the Amazon, which are really
located some 15&deg; of longitude west. It is nevertheless
curious that so far back as 1698 the existence
of the lagoon should be known at all&mdash;perhaps
they had heard of it from the adventurous Paulista
Bandeirantes&mdash;and that they should have placed it
nearly in its proper latitude and longitude on their
maps. Apparently Father John Joseph was not aware
of the existence of the Great Araguaya and Xingu
Rivers. Having compiled his map from information,
he confused those rivers into the S. Francisco River.</p>

Upon descending from the Serra into the valley
we soon came to a large forest with a luxuriant edge
of <i>peroba</i> (a word originating, I believe, from the words
<i>ipe</i> and <i>roba</i> in the <i>Tupi</i> language), which was known
in four different varieties: viz. the <i>peroba amarella</i>
(yellow), <i>parda</i> (brown), <i>revessa</i> (knotty), and <i>rosa</i>
(rose-coloured), technically named: <i>Aspidosperma polyneuron</i>
M. Arg., <i>Aspidosperma leucomelum</i> Warmg,
<i>Aspidosperma sp.</i>, <i>Aspidosperma dasycarpon</i> A.</p>

<p>Then there were also plentiful <i>garabu</i> and other
tall trees. Before getting to the edge of the forest I
noticed among the rocks some beautiful specimens of
the <i>apita</i> cactus, 10 ft. and more in height, in appearance
not unlike giant artichokes.</p>

<p>Near its beginning, where it was 3 metres wide and
6 in. deep, we crossed the Estivado River, which
with a group of other streamlets may share the honour
of being one of the sources of the Arinos. It flowed
in a north-westerly direction.</p>

<p>We were pushing on for all we were worth, for we
had come to the end of our food. Up and down we
went over a troublesome series of great elongated
ridges&mdash;like parallel dunes&mdash;the highest elevation on
them being 2,050 ft., the depressions 1,950 ft. We
came to a sweetly pretty streamlet, the Mollah,
flowing north into the Paraguay River, and shortly
afterwards to the Caitt&eacute; and the Corisho (elev. 1,500 ft.).
They were the three real and true sources of the Paraguay,
within a short distance of the Seven Lakes.</p>

<p>We had marched 50 kil. that day over rough country.
My animals were quite exhausted. Yet early next
morning we pushed on once more over transverse un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-417" id="Pg_1-417"></a>[<a href="./images/1-417.png">417</a>]</span>dulations
and across grassy <i>cuvettes</i>, slightly conical,
with circular pools of water in the centre and a florid
growth of bamboos in the lowest point of the <i>cuvettes</i>.
We ascended over more dyke-like obstructions on our
way (elev. 1,700 ft.) and descended once more into a
vast basin of campos with stunted trees. At its lowest
point there was from north-east to south-west a line
of magnificent tall trees. The forest was so dense
there that when we entered it we were quite in the
dark, as if going through a tunnel. There were fine
specimens of various kinds of the <i>jua</i> or <i>juaz</i> or <i>jurubeba</i>
(solanum), a medicinal plant 5 to 6 ft. high with
enormous dentate leaves&mdash;shaped not unlike a vine
leaf&mdash;possessing upright spikes on their dorsal or mid-rib
and on the veins of the leaf.</p>

<p>Then there was plentiful "<i>cepa de pappo</i>," a common
liana like a huge boa-constrictor winding its way in a
spiral up the tallest trees. I saw some of those liane
3 in. in diameter, with a smooth whitish bark.</p>

<p>The soil at the bottom of the valley (1,500 ft. above
sea level) was mostly composed of cinders, but up
the slopes white sand was predominant, mixed with
ashes. We travelled over a lava flow which formed the
bed of the River Macucu, flowing eastward. Guided
by the noise, we found a most beautiful waterfall, 100 ft.
high, over an extinct circular crater with vertical walls.
We kept on rising over a gentle incline, and having
reached an elevation of 1,750 ft. we found ourselves
suddenly on the upper edge of a great crescent-shaped
depression extending in a semicircle from north-east
to south-west. Its walls were one-tiered to the west,
with a flat table-land on their summit, but were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-418" id="Pg_1-418"></a>[<a href="./images/1-418.png">418</a>]</span>
divided into two terraces in the northern part where
ranges of hills rose on the plateau.</p>

<p>We had a rapid, steep descent among great rectangular
blocks of conglomerate (white marble pebbles
embedded in iron rock), great sheets of lava, and sediments
of red earth, solidified in places into half-formed
rock. I noticed extensive lava flows which had run
towards the west; then we came upon extraordinary
quantities of loose white marble pebbles and chips.
We made our way down upon a kind of spur of red lava,
frightfully slippery for my animals. The poor beasts
were quite worn out with fatigue.</p>

<p>From the round dome of the headland we perceived
to the south a second great circle of flat-topped heights.
The immense flow of red lava on which we were radiated
terrific heat which it had absorbed from the sun's rays.
My dogs, being nearer the ground than we were, had
great difficulty in breathing. Their heads and tails hung
low, and their tongues dangled fully out of their
mouths. They stumbled along panting pitifully. Even
we on our mounts felt nearly suffocated by the stifling
heat from the sun above and the lava below. The dogs
were amusing enough, curling down quickly to rest
wherever a mangy shrub gave the slightest suspicion
of a shade. The men, more stupid always than beasts,
were sweating and swearing freely, and thumped
mercilessly on the rumps of the tired animals with the
butts and muzzles of their rifles in order to urge them
along.</p>

<p>The very sound of the mules' neck-bells seemed tired
and worn; its brisk tinkling of our days of vigour had
given room to a monotonous and feeble, almost dead,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-419" id="Pg_1-419"></a>[<a href="./images/1-419.png">419</a>]</span>
ding ... dong, at long intervals&mdash;well suggesting the
exhaustion of the poor animals, which were just able
to drag along. The slightest obstacle&mdash;a loose stone,
a step in the lava, and now one animal, then another,
would collapse and roll down, and we had to dismount
and help them up on their feet again&mdash;quite a hard job,
I can tell you, when the animals were nearly dead and
would not get up again.</p>

<p>As we went along more and more headlands of the
great plateau appeared before us to the west. We
still went on descending on the top of the long spur of
lava. When not too busy with our animals&mdash;and quite
out of breath with the heat and stifling air from the
heated rock&mdash;I sometimes glanced at the glorious
panorama on both sides of us. When we had proceeded
farther I ascertained that there were really two
crescents contained side by side within a larger
crescent. Under us to the south a vast undulating
plain stretched as far as the eye could see towards
the south-west and west. On describing a revolution
upon your heels your eye met the other end
of the larger crescent plateau to the north-west. The
Serra do Tombador extended in a south-westerly direction
from north of Diamantino to S. Luiz de Caceres,
to the west of the Paraguay River. The height of the
spur on which we were was 1,350 ft. above the sea level.</p>

<p>We had come in a great circle on the upper edge.
A trail could be seen crossing the great undulating
valley below us. It passed at the western terminus
of the spur we were on. Evidently that was the trail
connecting Diamantino with Cuyab&aacute; (the capital of
Matto Grosso) via Rosario. The sight of a trail was most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-420" id="Pg_1-420"></a>[<a href="./images/1-420.png">420</a>]</span>
exhilarating to my men. Suddenly and quite unexpectedly
we came upon a few wretched, tumble-down
houses&mdash;if one may call them so&mdash;smothered in vegetation
which grew everywhere. My animals themselves
seemed astonished at the unusual sight. The
horses neighed and the mules brayed loudly. Masonry
work perhaps suggested to them more substantial
meals. Down a precipitous ravine, over large boulders
and stumbling into big holes, into which the mules
disappeared for a few seconds at a time ... there was
the main street of Diamantino.</p>

<p>The village&mdash;the local people called it "a city"&mdash;was
the very picture of misery, yet to us it seemed
as if we had dropped into the middle of London or
Paris. There were a few resident traders, two or three
Brazilians, two Italians, and a Turk. All were most
hospitable and kind. The chief industry of the place
was rubber, which found its way to the coast via the
Paraguay River.</p>

<p>Formerly Diamantino was a flourishing place because
diamonds were found in abundance. Even now they
can be found along the river, but the difficulty of access,
even by the easiest way, and the great expense of
living there have gradually depopulated the place,
which was quite in an abandoned state when I was
there.</p>

<p>Here are some of the minimum prices which the
rubber collectors had to pay for articles of necessity:
Beans, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> per litre,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or about 4<i>s.</i> a pound;
rice, 2<i>s.</i> per litre; flour, 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per litre, about 4<i>s.</i> a
pound; sugar, 5<i>s.</i> per kilo (2 pounds), rapadura, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-421" id="Pg_1-421"></a>[<a href="./images/1-421.png">421</a>]</span>
sugar block, 4<i>s.</i> per small cake; tobacco, 5<i>s.</i> per metre
of twist; salt, 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> per litre; coffee, 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
per kilo; lard, 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per kilo; purified lard in tins,
16<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> per 2 kilos. Bars of the commonest laundry
soap, 4<i>s.</i> each bar; chickens 10<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> each; eggs,
10<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> a dozen; small tins or sardines (containing
five sardines) of the most inferior kind, 10<i>s.</i> to 15<i>s.</i> a
tin; a one-pound tin of the commonest French salt
butter, 15<i>s.</i></p>

<p>A genial banquet was offered me on my arrival.
The school-mistress was set to prepare an excellent
and plentiful meal. The mayor and all the notabilities
of the place in their Sunday clothing came to fetch me
at the house of the firm of Orlando Bros., where I had
been most hospitably sheltered, and where I had been
requested to wait for them. At the appointed time
they arrived&mdash;in frock-coats, and each carrying an
umbrella.</p>

<p>"Is it raining?" I inquired in my astonishment
at seeing the array of articles which I had not seen for
several months&mdash;especially as a few minutes before I
had been outside and it was a lovely starlit night.</p>

<p>"Oh no, indeed, it is not raining; we carry the
umbrellas in due honour to you!" they replied in a
chorus, accompanied by a grand bow.</p>

<p>This was such an extraordinary compliment that
it really took me some time before I could grasp the
meaning of it. It seemed that according to the social
rules of Diamantino, Matto Grosso, no one could be
considered fully dressed unless carrying an umbrella.
Rain or shine, the people of Diamantino carried their
umbrellas on grand occasions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-422" id="Pg_1-422"></a>[<a href="./images/1-422.png">422</a>]</span>
After that one of the gentlemen pulled out of his
pocket a long slip of paper and proceeded to read a
speech of welcome. I answered in a few humble words.
Another gentleman&mdash;there were eight altogether&mdash;produced
another slip which he duly read in a sonorous
voice. Again I replied as best I could. Then, as I
was getting really anxious lest some one else should be
speechifying again, the mayor of the place offered me
his arm, and followed in a most respectful manner by
the others, we adjourned to the schoolroom, where the
feast was spread upon the table.</p>

<p>More speeches when we entered the room, more
speeches before we sat down, speeches in the middle of
dinner, speeches after dinner. Unaware of what was
coming, I had exhausted all the compliments I could
think of in my first speech, and I had to tax my poor
brain considerably to reply with grace&mdash;especially as I
had to speak in Portuguese&mdash;to the many charming
things which my thoughtful hosts said. The banquet
went off well. It is difficult to imagine more considerate,
kindly people than those exiles in that far-away spot.</p>

<p>I took careful and repeated astronomical observations
for latitude and longitude in order to establish
the exact position of that settlement. Lat. 14&deg; 21&#8242;&middot;7 S.;
Long. 56&deg; 56&#8242; W. I purchased all the food I could
possibly collect&mdash;enough to last us some six months,
which cost me a small fortune&mdash;as I intended to push
out of the place and proceed northward at once.</p>

<p>Four of my men became badly intoxicated upon
our arrival. There was another mutiny. They again
claimed their pay up to date and wished to leave me.
At once they received their money. It was such a relief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-423" id="Pg_1-423"></a>[<a href="./images/1-423.png">423</a>]</span>
to me when they went off, even for a few hours, that I
was always glad to give them the money and have a
short mental rest while they kept away. Unfortunately
it was impossible to obtain a single extra man in
Diamantino. Labour was scarce, and the few labourers
in existence were in absolute slavery. Indeed, slavery
existed&mdash;it exists to-day&mdash;in all Central Brazil, just as
it did before slavery was abolished. Only in the old
days of legal slavery it was limited to negroes; now the
slaves are negroes, mulattoes, white people, even some
Europeans. I have seen with my own eyes a German
gentleman of refinement in that humble condition.</p>

<p>In the present condition of things the slave, in the
first instance, sells himself or is sold by his family.
There were indeed few, if any, of the labouring classes
in Matto Grosso and Goyaz provinces who were free
men or women. All were owned by somebody, and
if you wished to employ them&mdash;especially to take them
away from a village or a city&mdash;you had to purchase
them from their owners. That meant that if you intended
to employ a man&mdash;even for a few days&mdash;you
had to disburse a purchase sum equivalent to two or
three hundred pounds sterling, sometimes more. In the
following way it was made impossible for the slaves to
become free again. Taking advantage of the poverty
and vanity of those people, loans of money were offered
them in the first instance, and also luxuries in the way
of tinned food, clothing, revolvers and rifles. When
once they had accepted, and could not repay the sum
or value of the articles received, they became the
property of the lender, who took good care to increase
the debt constantly by supplying cheap articles to them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-424" id="Pg_1-424"></a>[<a href="./images/1-424.png">424</a>]</span>
at fifty times their actual cost. The <i>seringueiro</i>, or
rubber collector, had a <i>caderneta</i>, or booklet and the
master a <i>livro maestro</i>, or account book, in which
often double the quantity of articles actually received
by the rubber collector were entered. The debt thus
increased by leaps and bounds, and in a short time a
labourer owed his master, two, three hundred pounds.
The rubber collectors tried hard to repay the debt in
rubber, which they sold to their masters at a low rate;
but it was always easy for the masters to keep the men
in debt.</p>

<p>It must be said for the masters that their slaves were
not in any way ill-treated; on the contrary&mdash;except
that a man was seldom given the slightest chance of
redeeming himself&mdash;they were indeed treated as well
as circumstances permitted. Labour, it must be remembered,
was so scarce and valuable&mdash;it was almost
an impossibility to obtain labour in Central Brazil&mdash;that
it was the care of the master not to lose a labourer.</p>

<p>Much is to be said for the honour of even the worst
types of Brazilians. Although many of them would
not think twice of murdering or robbing a stranger of
all he possessed, they were seldom known to defraud
their owners by escaping. A man who ran away from
his owner was looked down upon by the entire community.
Again, it must be stated that the chances of
escape, in those distant regions, were indeed very
remote. An escaped slave with no money could not
go very far and he would soon die of starvation.</p>

<p>I must confess that, although I tried hard to discover
a way by which labour could be obtained and
retained in Brazil with the existing laws, I could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-425" id="Pg_1-425"></a>[<a href="./images/1-425.png">425</a>]</span>
find one practicable except that used by the Brazilians,
viz. slavery.</p>

<p>The people of Diamantino tried hard to induce
one or two men to accompany me&mdash;and I was willing
to buy them out and eventually would have set them
free altogether at the end of the expedition&mdash;but they
were all so terrified of the Indians if they left the
"city" that they preferred to remain slaves.</p>

<p>Alcides had gone round to look for a barber. There
was only one in Diamantino, and he was in prison for the
murder of his wife, or for some other such trifling matter.
Armed with a pair of my scissors, Alcides went to the
prison to have his hair cut. Once there he took the
opportunity to explain to the prisoner that it could be
arranged to procure his escape if he were willing to join
the expedition. The barber&mdash;who had not inquired
which way we should be travelling&mdash;jumped at the
idea. This necessitated having my hair cut too&mdash;rather
a trial with scissors that did not cut&mdash;in order to
arrange matters further in detail. With a special
permission from the local authorities the barber was
let out accompanied by two policemen&mdash;the only two
in the place&mdash;in order that he might reduce my hair by
half its length or more.</p>

<p>While I underwent actual torture in having my
hair clipped&mdash;as the prisoner's hands were trembling
with excitement, and my ears had various narrow
escapes&mdash;Alcides, who, when he wished, had very
persuasive manners, induced not only the prisoner, but
the two policemen&mdash;all three&mdash;to escape and join the
expedition. I must say that I did not at all look
forward to the prospect of my three new companions;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-426" id="Pg_1-426"></a>[<a href="./images/1-426.png">426</a>]</span>
but we were in terrible want of hands. I had visions
that my expedition would be entirely wrecked. There
was a limit to human endurance and we could not
perform miracles. We still had thousands of kilometres
to travel over most difficult and dangerous
country. Besides, I reflected, after all, I might only be
performing an act of kindness by relieving the town of
the expense and trouble of keeping its only prisoner, not
to speak of the police force.</p>

<p>All was satisfactorily arranged, when the prisoner
inquired where we were going. You should have seen
his face when I told him.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" he quickly replied. "No, no, no,
no!" and he waved my scissors in the air. "I will not
come! I will remain in prison all my life rather than
be eaten up by cannibals! No, no, no, no ... no, no,
no, no...!" he went on muttering at intervals as he
gave the last clipping touches to my hair. He hastened
through his job, received his pay in silence, and asked
the policemen to take him back quickly to the prison.
When the chains, which had temporarily been removed,
were put again around his wrists, he departed shaking
his head and muttering again&mdash;"No, no, no, no...!"</p>

<p>The wise policemen, too, said that naturally, as
their prisoner would not escape, they were obliged to
remain and keep guard over him ... it was not through
lack of courage that they would not come; it was
because of their duty!</p>

<p>Of course, Alcides was sadly disappointed, but I
was delighted, when it all fell through.</p>

<p>I owe the success of my expeditions to the fact that,
no matter what happens, I never will stop anywhere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-427" id="Pg_1-427"></a>[<a href="./images/1-427.png">427</a>]</span>
It is quite fatal, on expeditions of that kind, to stop
for any length of time. If you do, the fatigue, the
worry, and illness make it generally impossible to start
again&mdash;all things which you do not feel quite so much
as long as you can keep moving. Many a disaster in
exploring expeditions could easily have been avoided,
had the people known this secret of successful travelling.
Push on at all costs&mdash;until, of course, you are actually
dead.</p>

<p>With my reduced party of two men (Alcides and
Filippe) I had to arrange matters differently, and
decided to abandon part of my baggage&mdash;all things, in
fact, which were not absolutely necessary, taking only
food, instruments for scientific observations, cameras
and photographic plates.</p>

<p>Alcides and Filippe&mdash;who by then had become most
adventurous&mdash;and I were about to start on July 1st,
and were making things ready, when two of my deserters
returned and begged me to take them along again.
They had found living at their own cost rather expensive,
and had realized that it would have been an
impossibility for them to get out of that place again
with the funds at their disposal. Each meal had cost
them a small fortune. Animals were extremely expensive,
and it was then the wrong season for launches
to come up the river as far as Rosario, the nearest port
to the south.</p>

<p>"We will come with you," said they, in a sudden
outburst of devotion. "We will come. We are brave
men. You have always been good and generous to us.
We are sorry for what we have done. Order us and
we will kill anybody you like for you!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-428" id="Pg_1-428"></a>[<a href="./images/1-428.png">428</a>]</span>
Brazilians of that class have only one idea in their
heads&mdash;killing, killing, killing!</p>

<p>That was more devotion than I demanded. In
order to spare Alcides and Filippe, and myself&mdash;as the
work thrown upon us would have indeed been beyond
our possible strength&mdash;I re-employed the two men on
the express condition that they should murder no one
while they were with me.</p>

<p>At noon of July 1st, accompanied by a mounted
escort of honour of the leading citizens with the Mayor
at their head, I left Diamantino (elev. 1,030 ft.), travelling
north-east. We ascended to the summit of a
table-land&mdash;the first terrace of which was at an elevation
of 1,250 ft., the higher at 1,600 ft. The last words
I had heard from a venerable old man as I rode out of
Diamantino still rang in my ears.</p>

<p>"You are going to sure death&mdash;good-bye!..."
On reaching the top of the plateau the courteous friends
who had accompanied me also bade me an affectionate
farewell. I could see by their faces and their manner
that they were saying good-bye to one they believed a
doomed man.</p>

<p>"If by chance you come out alive," said the Mayor,
in a tentative way, "we should like to have news of
you."</p>

<p>On dismal occasions of that kind the sky is always
gloomy and black and there is always drizzling rain.
So that day, too, the weather did not fail to add to our
depressed spirits.</p>

<p>On leaving our friends we started to plunge once
more into the unknown. On reaching the top edge
of the plateau we witnessed a wonderful sight, rendered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-429" id="Pg_1-429"></a>[<a href="./images/1-429.png">429</a>]</span>
more poetic by the slight vagueness of a veil of mist.
To the south of Diamantino was the Serra Tombador,
extending as far as S. Luiz de Caceres, about 250 kil.
as the crow flies to the south-west. Then below us was
the Lag&otilde;a dos Veados with no outlet, and close by the
head-waters of the Rio Preto (a tributary of the Arinos).
The Serra do Tombador was parallel nearly all along
with the River Paraguay.</p>

<p>Owing to departing so late in the day from Diamantino,
and the time we had wasted on the way with social
compliments, we were only able to go 12 kil. that
afternoon. We halted near the shed of a <i>seringueiro</i>
(rubber collector), at an elevation of 1,530 ft., close to
the Chapes&agrave;, a streamlet flowing into the Agua Fria
(cold water), which in its turn threw itself into the Rio
Preto.</p>

<p>It was muggy and warm during the night&mdash;min.
65&deg; Fahr.&mdash;with swarms of mosquitoes. We were
glad to leave the next morning, following a north-westerly
course across a wonderfully beautiful meadow
with circular groups of trees and a long belt of vegetation
along the stream. It was then that I made my first
acquaintance in Brazil with the <i>seringueira</i> (<i>Syphonia
elastica</i> or <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>), which was fairly
plentiful in that region. As we shall see, that rubber
tree, producing the best rubber known, became more
and more common as we proceeded north.</p>

<p>In the cuts of rivers, soft red volcanic rock was
exposed, with a surface layer of white sand and grey
ashes in the flat meadow. The padding of earth was
thin. Except close to rivers and in extinct craters
where the accumulations of earth and cinders were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-430" id="Pg_1-430"></a>[<a href="./images/1-430.png">430</a>]</span>
often deeper with a good supply of moisture from
underneath, the trees were feeble and an&aelig;mic. There
again I was amazed to find how unstable and weak
most trees were. One could knock them down with a
mere hard push&mdash;as the roots had no hold in the ground,
where they spread horizontally almost on the surface,
owing to the rock underneath which prevented their
penetrating farther than the thin upper layer of earth,
sand, and ashes. If you happened to lean against a
tree 4 or 5 in. in diameter, it was not uncommon to
see the tree tumble down and you too. The wood also
of those trees was very brittle and watery, with no
power of resistance worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Many were the streamlets which flowed into the
Rio Preto at elevations from 1,450 to 1,500 ft., viz. the
Burity Comprido, the Bujui, the Grinko, the Pomba,
the Corgo do Campo, the Riber&atilde;o Grande, and the
Stiva. Many of those streamlets had beautiful beds
of white marble pebbles, which made their cool and
clear water look and taste perfectly delicious. Others,
with soft black mud bottoms&mdash;especially in <i>cuvettes</i>&mdash;were
extremely troublesome to cross.</p>

<p>On the banks of those streams were marvellous
<i>pacobeira</i> palms&mdash;a kind of giant banana palm, attaining
a height of 30 to 40 ft., with a stem, ovoid in section,
of great length, and from which shot out paddle-like
leaves of immense size and of a gorgeous green, 6 to
7 ft. long and 3 ft. wide.</p>

<p>On July 3rd we went through thick, dirty, low
scrub and forest, except along streams, the banks of
which were lined with tall an&aelig;mic trees 1 inch in
diameter with a mere bunch of leaves from branches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_1-431" id="Pg_1-431"></a>[<a href="./images/1-431.png">431</a>]</span>
at the summit. We again met with several <i>cuvettes</i>&mdash;very
grassy, with the usual florid growth of trees in the
centre. Those depressions were 1,400 ft. above the
sea level. From many of the trees hung huge globes,
like tumours. They were nests of <i>cupim</i>, the destructive
white ants (<i>termes album</i>), of which there were swarms
everywhere in that region. In one night they ate up
the bottoms of most of my wooden boxes and rendered
many of our possessions useless. They ate up our
clothes, injured our saddles by eating the stitching&mdash;anything
that was not of metal, glass, or polished
leather was destroyed by those little devils.</p>

<p>We were beginning to descend gradually on the
northern side of the table-land. After crossing a pass
1,350 ft. above the sea level we arrived on a lagoon
to our left. Shortly after we reached the left bank of
the Arinos River, separated there from the lagoon by
a narrow tongue of high land&mdash;some 30 ft. high&mdash;between
the two waters.</p>

<p>It was thus that on July 4th we encamped on that
great tributary of the Amazon. We were still thousands
of kilometres away from its mouth. My animals were
quite exhausted and were unable to continue. Moreover,
the forest near this great river&mdash;already, so near
its birthplace, over 100 metres wide&mdash;would have made
their coming along quite impossible, as the grazing
was getting scarce, and would be scarcer still as we
went on north. Then as the River Arinos took me
in the direction in which I intended to travel, I had
made up my mind to abandon the animals at that spot
and attempt to navigate the river&mdash;diabolical as its
reputation was.</p>

We had now travelled on horseback some 2,000 kil.
from the last railway station, of which about 600 kil.
were over absolutely unknown country. Rough as the
travelling had been, it was mere child's play compared
with the experiences we had to endure from that
day on.</p>
