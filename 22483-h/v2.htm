<h2><a name="II_CHAPTER_I" id="II_CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The River Arinos&mdash;A Rickety Canoe&mdash;Mapping the River&mdash;The
<i>Siphonia Elastica</i>&mdash;Rubber and its Collection&mdash;An Enormously Rich
Country&mdash;A German in Slavery</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> struck the River Arinos at a point called Porto
Velho. There were at that place the miserable sheds
of three <i>seringueiros</i> (rubber-collectors). I had made
for that particular spot because I had heard that a
big canoe carved out of the trunk of a tree probably
existed there. I was told that the canoe was large
enough to carry many people. It had been constructed,
it seemed, some ten years previously by a
rubber-collecting expedition which came to grief, was
abandoned, and had since been taken possession of by
seringueiros. I had purchased it on chance from its
last owner for Rs. 300,000. With accessories I gave
about Rs. 450,000, or roughly, &pound;30. It was the only
canoe upon that river.</p>

<p>I considered myself lucky, when I arrived at
Porto Velho, to find that the canoe actually existed
at all. There she was, floating more or less gracefully
upon the water. She had a total length of 42 ft.,
was 3&frac12; ft. wide, and had been roughly scooped out of
a giant tree which was not quite straight. Her
lines, therefore, were not as elegant as might have
been expected. For instance, her starboard and port<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-2" id="Pg_2-2"></a>[<a href="./images/2-2.png">2</a>]</span>
sides were not absolutely straight lines, but described
curves&mdash;in fact, the port side almost an angle. That
gave the canoe an original appearance, which to my
practical mind at once suggested great difficulty of
steering. Her sides, coarsely cut with an axe, were
from 3 to 5 in. thick; her bottom from 6 in. to 1 ft.
thick. The two extremities were solid blocks, so that
her weight&mdash;she was carved out of unusually heavy
wood&mdash;was altogether over 2,000 lb.</p>

<p>When I went down to the water to examine my
purchase I found that the vessel was in a pitiful condition
and needed sound repairing before she could
proceed on a long journey. She was sufficiently good
for crossing the stream&mdash;that was all she was used
for by the seringueiros&mdash;but it would be a different
matter to go down rapids for some thousands of kilometres.
It took all the strength of my men, the
seringueiros, and myself combined to pull the canoe
out of the water upon the beach and to turn her over.
We worked hard for two days with saws and hammers,
knives, tar and wadding, in order to stop up a gigantic
crack which extended from one end of the canoe to
the other under her bottom. Although the crack did
not go right through, I could well imagine that a
hard knock against a rock might be quite sufficient to
split the canoe in two. We scraped her and cleaned
her; we overhauled and strengthened her thoroughly;
we cut rough seats inside, and built an elevated deck
upon which the baggage might be comparatively safe
from moisture.</p>

<p>We were proud of our work when we launched her.
Wiping the dripping perspiration from our foreheads,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-3" id="Pg_2-3"></a>[<a href="./images/2-3.png">3</a>]</span>
necks and arms, we looked just as if we had come
out of a bath, we sweated so in our efforts to push
her back into the water, the heat near the water,
screened as it was from the breeze by the high banks
and trees, being suffocating! We gazed at her&mdash;the
queen of the Arinos River. She looked lovely in our
eyes. On her stern I fixed the steering gear, a huge
paddle 12 ft. long; and upon a neatly-made staff,
which I had cut myself, I hoisted the British flag,
which had hitherto flown over my tent. It was, I
think, the first time the British flag had waved over
that river. The canoe was baptized the "Elfrida,"
after my sister's name.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that only four men remained
with me. Not one of them had ever been in
a canoe before&mdash;except to be ferried across a river,
perhaps&mdash;not one had the slightest idea of navigation,
and it followed, of course, that not one had ever used
a paddle or steered a canoe.</p>

<p>As the river had never been surveyed, it was my
intention to make an accurate map of its entire course as
far as its junction with the Tres Barras, several thousand
kils. away, from which point I imagined the river
must be slightly better known. Therefore, as I should
be busy all day long with the prismatic compass and
watch, constantly taking notes of the direction of the
stream and the distances covered (checked almost
daily by astronomical observations) I should not be
able to take an active part in the navigation.</p>

<p>The canoe was undermanned. Imagine her length&mdash;42
ft.&mdash;with only two men to paddle. A third man
was stationed on her bow to punt when possible and be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-4" id="Pg_2-4"></a>[<a href="./images/2-4.png">4</a>]</span>
on the look-out for rocks; while Alcides, whom I had
promoted to the rank of quartermaster, was in charge
of the steering. I had taken the precaution to make
a number of extra paddles. We carried a large quantity
of fishing-lines with hooks of all sizes, and cartridges
of dynamite.</p>

<p>The river was most placid and beautiful, and the
water wonderfully clear. Unlike rivers elsewhere, the
Arinos did not show a branch or a twig floating on
its waters, not a leaf on its mirror-like surface. That
did not mean that branches of trees&mdash;sometimes even
whole trees&mdash;did not fall into the river, but, as I have
stated already, the specific gravity of woods in that
part of Brazil was so heavy that none floated. Hence
the ever-clean surface of all the streams.</p>

<p>We were then in a region of truly beautiful forest,
with <i>figueira</i> (<i>Ficus</i> of various kinds), trees of immense
size, and numerous large <i>cambar&aacute;</i>. The bark of the
latter&mdash;reddish in colour&mdash;when stewed in boiling
water, gave a refreshing decoction not unlike tea and
quite good to drink.</p>

<p>Most interesting of all the trees was, however, the
seringueira (<i>Siphonia elastica</i>), which was extraordinarily
plentiful in belts or zones along the courses
of rivers in that region. As is well known, the
seringueira, which grows wild in the forest there, is
one of the most valuable lactiferous plants in the world.
Its latex, properly coagulated, forms the best quality
of rubber known.</p>

<p class="fsc">Coagulating Rubber into a Ball.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are, of course, many latex-giving plants of
the <i>Euphorbi&aelig;</i>, <i>Artocarp&aelig;</i> and <i>Lobeli&aelig;</i> families, but no
other are perhaps such abundant givers of latex as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-5" id="Pg_2-5"></a>[<a href="./images/2-5.png">5</a>]</span>
Brazilian seringueira (of the <i>Euphorbi&aelig;</i> family), a tree
plentiful not only in Matto Grosso on all the head-waters
and courses of the rivers flowing into the
Amazon, but also abundant in the Provinces of Para
and the Amazon. In less quantities the seringueira is
also to be found in Cear&aacute;, Rio Grande do Norte and
Maranh&atilde;o.</p>

<p>The seringueira prevailed chiefly near the water,
in swampy places, or in places inundated when the
river was high. Never was the tree to be found at a
distance away from water.</p>

<p>The height of the seringueira varies from 25 ft. to
50 ft. Its diameter is seldom more than 35 in. Its
leaf is composed of three elongated leaflets, smooth-edged
and complete in themselves. The seed is smooth-skinned,
and of a reddish tone. The fruit consists of
a well-rounded wooden capsule enclosing three cells
which contain white oily almonds not disagreeable to
eat. From the almonds an oil of a light red colour,
not unlike the colour of old port wine, can be extracted.
That oil can be substituted for linseed oil, and has the
further advantage of not desiccating so quickly. Mixed
with copal and turpentine it gives a handsome varnish.
It can be used advantageously in the manufacture of
printing-ink and soap. So that every part of the
seringueira can be put to some use or other.</p>

<p>Among the other more important trees which produce
rubber may be mentioned the <i>Siphonia brevifoglia</i>,
the <i>Siphonia brasiliensis</i>, <i>Siphonia rhytidocarpa</i>, and
the <i>Siphonia lutea</i>, all found chiefly in the State of
Para. In other parts of Brazil grow the <i>Ficus anthelmintica</i>,
the <i>Ficus doliaria</i> (or <i>gameilleira</i>), the <i>Ficus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-6" id="Pg_2-6"></a>[<a href="./images/2-6.png">6</a>]</span>
elastica</i>, <i>Ficus indica</i>, <i>Ficus religiosa</i>, <i>Ficus radula</i>,
<i>Ficus elliptica</i>, <i>Ficus prinoides</i>, the <i>Plumeria phagedenica</i>,
the <i>Plumeria drastica</i>, the <i>Sorveira</i> or <i>Collophora
utilis</i>, and the <i>Mangabeira</i> or <i>Harncornia speciosa</i>.</p>

<p>At present we shall be chiefly interested in the
seringueira (<i>Siphonia elastica</i>).</p>

<p>The collection of the latex from the seringueira
and the subsequent process of coagulation were simple
enough. A seringueiro, or rubber-collector, started
from his hut early every morning carrying with him
a small steel axe or pick, the head of which was 3 in.
long and shaped like a bird's beak; a tin bucket, and
some <i>barro</i>&mdash;soft clay which had been soaked in water.
He walked along the <i>estrada</i> or track which he had
cleared for himself, leading from one rubber tree to
the next. There may be twenty, thirty, fifty or more
rubber trees that have been tapped on one estrada,
according to the district and the activity of the seringueiro.
In the case of a new tree a collar of the fibre
of burity palm was in the first instance nailed with
pegs of hard wood round the stem, not horizontally,
but at an angle: sometimes, when necessary, in a
spiral. In other cases a similar band of clay was
made to encircle the tree. These collars served as
channels, compelling the latex, as it exuded from cuts
made in the tree, to flow into a small tin cup suspended
at the lowest point of the collar. The incisions were
never made lower than 2 or 3 ft. from the ground.
They must not penetrate deeper than the entire thickness
of the bark of the tree, and they must on no
account touch or wound the actual wood, or the tree
would suffer greatly&mdash;even die. In some regions the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-7" id="Pg_2-7"></a>[<a href="./images/2-7.png">7</a>]</span>
incisions were made longitudinally, in others transversely.
The operation was repeated by the seringueiro
each time on every rubber tree as he went along the
estrada, the latex flowing freely enough into the tin
cup after each fresh incision had been made.</p>

<p>The seringueiro thus tapped each tree on his way
out along the estrada, which in some cases may be
several miles long; in other cases, where rubber trees
were plentiful, only a few hundred yards in length. On
his return journey the seringueiro emptied each small
tin cup&mdash;by that time filled with latex&mdash;into the large
bucket which invariably accompanied him on his
daily round. Rubber-trees possess in a way at least
one characteristic of cows. The more milk or latex
one judiciously extracts from them, the more they give,
up to a certain point. But, indeed, such a thing is
known as exhausting a tree in a short time. A good
seringueiro usually gives the trees a rest from the
time they are in bloom until the fruit is mature. In
some regions even a much longer respite is given to
the trees&mdash;generally during the entire rainy season. In
some localities, too, in order to let the latex flow more
freely, a vertical incision is made above and meeting a
horizontal one. At intervals oblique incisions are cut
next to the vertical ones, but in Matto Grosso I never
saw that complicated system of incisions adopted&mdash;only
vertical incisions parallel to one another at a
distance of 0&middot;25 <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'c'">m</ins>. (9&#8542; in.) being made there, and in
rows one above another. Some of the trees had
actually hundreds of those cuts&mdash;many, of course,
healed. Each cut only exudes latex for a comparatively
short time, merely an hour or so.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-8" id="Pg_2-8"></a>[<a href="./images/2-8.png">8</a>]</span>
During the first month after a tree is tapped, the
supply of latex is generally plentiful; the second month
it gives less; less still the third month. On an
average twenty trees give about one litre of latex a
day. Three litres of latex are necessary in order to
obtain one litre of rubber. At the head-waters of the
Arinos River 600 trees gave from 30 to 35 arobas (450
to 525 kils.) of fine rubber in the first month, and
about 20 arobas (300 kils.) of <i>sarnamb&eacute;</i> (second quality
with impurities). One aroba is 15 kils.</p>

<p>The latex of the seringueira in the Arinos region
was of a beautiful white, quite liquid, and with a
pungent, almost sickening, odour. When a new tree
was tapped, the lower towards the ground the incisions
were made the better. If after considerable tapping
the tree did not yield much, it was advisable to incise
the tree higher up. In that region the trees exuded
latex more abundantly when they began to have new
leaves in October. Late in the dry season the latex
flowed less freely. When the weather was windy all
the latex seemed to contract to the summit of the
trees and hardly flowed at all from the incisions. When
it rained, on the contrary, it flowed freely, but was
spoilt by being mixed with water; so that a good
seringueiro must know well not only where and how,
but also when to tap the trees, in order to get good
results.</p>

<p class="fsc">Method of Pressing Rubber into Cakes.</p>
<p class="figcenter">The alum process of coagulation being used.</p>
<hr />
<p>Several ways were employed in order to coagulate
the latex. The simplest was the one used in Matto
Grosso. The latex was poured into a rectangular
wooden mould, 0&middot;61 m. long (2 ft.), 0&middot;46 m. wide (1&frac12; ft.),
and 0&middot;15 m. deep (about 6 in.). Upon the latex was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-9" id="Pg_2-9"></a>[<a href="./images/2-9.png">9</a>]</span>
placed a solution of alum and warm water. Then
coagulation took place. In order to compress the
coagulating latex into solid cakes, a primitive lever
arrangement was used&mdash;merely a heavy wooden bar,
one end of which was inserted into the cavity of a
tree, above the wooden mould, while at the other end
of the bar heavy logs of wood were suspended. One
night was sufficient for the latex to coagulate thoroughly
and be properly compressed into cakes, weighing each
about 22&frac12; kils. The cakes were lifted out by belts
of liane which had been previously laid into the
moulds.</p>

<p>The discoverer of the method of coagulating rubber
with alum was Henry S. Strauss. He also found that
by keeping the latex in hermetically sealed vessels it
could be preserved in a liquid state. The same result
could be obtained with ammonia.</p>

<p>In the Amazon and Para Provinces a different process
was used. The latex was coagulated by placing
it near the fire. The heat evaporated the aqueous part
and coagulated the vegetable albumen. In order to
make what was called a <i>garrafa</i>, or large ball of rubber&mdash;some
weighed 20, 30, 40 kils. and more&mdash;a small
ball of latex was made to coagulate round a horizontal
bar of wood. That ball was gradually increased in
circumference by smearing it over with more latex,
which became gradually coagulated and dried by the
heat and smoke produced by the burning of certain
woods, and of the oily seeds of the <i>urucuri</i> palm,
technically known as the <i>Attalea excelsa</i>. In this process
the rubber did not remain white, as with the alum
process; in fact, it became dark brown, almost black,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-10" id="Pg_2-10"></a>[<a href="./images/2-10.png">10</a>]</span>
owing, of course, to the smoke. Locally, the smoking
process was said to be the better of the two, for the
coagulation with alum took away somewhat from the
elasticity of the rubber.</p>

<p>Interesting was the <i>sorveira</i> (<i>Collophora utilis</i>), a
tree which gave latex that was quite delicious to
drink, but could not be coagulated. The trees, to any
untrained person, closely resembled the seringueira,
only the leaves were more minute and differently shaped.
It must be remembered that nearly all the trees of the
Brazilian forest had leaves only at a very great height
above the ground, and it was not always easy to see
their shape, especially when close to other trees where
the foliage got interwoven into an almost solid mass.
We frequently enjoyed the sweet milk of the <i>sorveira</i>&mdash;it
tasted slightly of fresh walnuts with sugar on
them. It was unsafe to drink too much of it, as it had
injurious effects upon one's digestive organs.</p>

<p>There was there also the <i>leiteiro</i> (or producer of
milk), a smaller tree, and the liana <i>macaco</i>, which both
produced abundant milk, but in neither case had a
way, so far, been found to coagulate it.</p>

<p>The two days spent at Porto Velho were interesting.
The four men who had remained with me behaved
fairly well, principally owing to the prospect,
that, in drifting down stream, they would not have to
work, and would be saved the heavy trouble of grooming,
packing and unpacking the animals, and the
tedious job every morning of riding miles through the
country in order to recover those that had strayed
away during the night.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" exclaimed Antonio, as he gazed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-11" id="Pg_2-11"></a>[<a href="./images/2-11.png">11</a>]</span>
at the canoe, "we shall not have to hunt for her every
morning!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Filippe, "no more pack-saddles
to fix, no more leading the animals to drink. She"&mdash;pointing
to the canoe&mdash;"can drink all the time if she
likes...."</p>

<p>Filippe was a prophet. The canoe did "drink"
all the time, much to our concern. Little did my
men suspect before we started that they would have
the hardest time of their lives&mdash;so hard, indeed, that it
was amazing humans could endure it at all.</p>

<p>One of the three seringueiros at Porto Velho interested
me greatly. He was a tall, gentlemanly,
refined person, who seldom uttered a word. I noticed
that he avoided meeting me, and, although extremely
civil, seemed afraid to enter into conversation. The
little shed he had built himself (7 ft. by 4 ft., and
7 ft. high) was extraordinarily neat, and open on all
sides&mdash;quite unlike the sheds Brazilian rubber collectors
build themselves.</p>

<p>From my tent I watched him. The man got up
before sunrise every day, going at once to the river
for a swim. Humming some sort of a song, he would
then go through a series of gymnastic exercises, interrupted
by sonorous slaps upon different parts of his
anatomy to kill impertinent mosquitoes, of which there
were swarms on the Arinos River. That done, he would
assume a suit of working-clothes, and, returning to
his shed, would pick up his tools and noiselessly depart,
so as not to disturb our sleep! At sunset, when he
returned, he immediately proceeded to the river to
have another swim and to get rid of the many insects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-12" id="Pg_2-12"></a>[<a href="./images/2-12.png">12</a>]</span>
which always collected upon one's person in going
through the forest. Then he put on a clean suit of
clothes, and, saluting us from a distance, went to his
shed to rest.</p>

<p>I was certain the man was not a Brazilian, but as
curiosity is not one of my chief characteristics I took
no special notice of him. This brought him round
to my tent one evening. The man was a German by
birth, of a good family and excellent education. He
could speak German, English, French, Spanish and
Portuguese to perfection, and was well versed in
the literature of those languages. He had evidently
drifted about for many years in many parts of South
America in search of a fortune, in the Argentine, in
Uruguay, and had ended by becoming a slave in Brazil.
Yes, the poor old man was a voluntary slave. He
had borrowed from his employer and was unable to
repay. He was therefore a slave in the true sense
of the word, as his employer could, according to local
custom, sell him to any one he chose.</p>

<hr />
<p>I was terribly upset to see a European in such a
position, and, what was worse, I was not in a position
to help. Nor indeed was help asked for or wanted.
The old fellow bore the burden bravely, and said he
had never been happier in his life. Supposing he were
made to return to his own country&mdash;from which he had
been absent so many years&mdash;he philosophically argued,
what could he be, with no money and no friends, but
a most unhappy man? All his relatives and friends
must have died; the habits he had acquired in the
wilds were not suitable for European cities; he was
too old to change them. The German was an extra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-13" id="Pg_2-13"></a>[<a href="./images/2-13.png">13</a>]</span>ordinarily
fine type of a man, honest, straightforward,
brave. He spoke in the kindest and fairest way of
his master. He had sold himself because of necessity.
It was now a matter of honour, and he would remain
a slave until it was possible to repay the purchase
money&mdash;some four hundred pounds sterling, if I remember
rightly&mdash;which he never expected to be able
to repay at all.</p>

<p>The German told me some interesting things about
the immediate neighbourhood of the camp. The
Indians of the Cayapo tribe, who lived close by, did
not interfere with the seringueiros. He had been there
several years in succession, and he had never seen an
Indian. The seringueiros only went to collect rubber
during some three or four months each year, after
which time they returned to the distant towns south
as far as Cuyab&aacute; and Corumb&aacute;. At the beginning of
the rainy season, when the time came for them to
retire, the Indians generally began to remind the
seringueiros that it was time to go, by placing obstacles
on the estrada, by removing cups or even the collars
from the rubber trees. But so far in that region, although
footmarks of Indians and other signs of them
had been noticed, not one individual had been actually
seen. Their voices were frequently heard in the distance
singing war songs.</p>

<p>"Hark!" said the German to me, "do you hear
them?"</p>

<p>I listened attentively. Far, far down the river a
faint chorus of voices could just be heard&mdash;intermittent
sounds of "hu&aacute; ... hu&aacute; ... hu&aacute; ... hu&aacute;."
In the stillness of the night the sound could be dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-14" id="Pg_2-14"></a>[<a href="./images/2-14.png">14</a>]</span>tinguished
clearly. It went on until sunrise, when it
gradually died out.</p>

<p>There was a big lagoon to the west of Porto Velho,
formed by the river at high water. The lagoon dried
up during the dry season. It was separated from the
river only by a narrow tongue of land, 80 ft. high.</p>

<p>I took careful and repeated observations for latitude,
longitude, and altitude, the latter by a boiling-point
thermometer, from our point of departure at the
headwaters of the Arinos River. The elevation of the
river was there 1,200 ft. by aneroid, 1,271 ft. by
the hypsometrical apparatus. The latitude was 14&deg;
2&#8242;&middot;2 South; the longitude 56&deg; 17&#8242; West of Greenwich.</p>

<p>We were having beautiful, clear skies. Only on
July 4th at sunset a solitary streak of mist extended
to the summit of the sky.</p>

<p>I had two plans in my mind when I decided to
descend the Arinos River. One was to abandon that
river at the point where it met the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jurnena'">Juruena</ins> River and
strike across country westward until the Madeira-Mamore
Railway was met. The other plan&mdash;even
more difficult&mdash;was to continue down the river as far
as its junction with the Tres Barras, from which place
I would strike across the virgin forest as far as the
Madeira River. I had not the faintest idea how I
could realize either plan with the ridiculously meagre
resources at my disposal. I had money enough, but
unfortunately that was one of the few spots on earth
where money was of little use. Again I trusted in
Providence to come to our help. Both plans involved
thousands of kilometres of navigation of a diabolical
river, in an almost uncontrollable canoe, with an in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-15" id="Pg_2-15"></a>[<a href="./images/2-15.png">15</a>]</span>sufficient
and absolutely incapable crew. Then would
come the crossing of the virgin forest on foot, for some
hundreds of kilometres&mdash;nobody knew how many. The
least number of men necessary in order to be able to
carry provisions sufficient to execute either plan was
thirty. I only had four. Yet I started. The second
plan was successfully carried out, but necessarily at
the cost almost of all our lives, and with sufferings
unimaginable.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Hoisting the British Flag&mdash;An Escaped Slave&mdash;A Dilemma&mdash;Benedicto&mdash;The
<i>Lutra Brasiliensis</i>&mdash;The Seringueiros&mdash;A Marvellous River&mdash;Rapids</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> July 6th we packed the canoe with our baggage
and dogs. The British flag was hoisted at the stern
of the canoe, and with tender embraces from the
seringueiros, whose eyes were wet with tears&mdash;they
imagined that we were going to certain death&mdash;we
pulled out of Porto Velho at seven minutes to eleven
o'clock a.m.</p>

<p>"We will pray with all our hearts that you may
reach the end of your journey safely!... Beware
of the rapids; they are terrible.... Be careful because
the canoe does not steer true.... Do not let the
canoe knock too hard against rocks, or she may split
in two!... Good-bye!... good-bye!"</p>

<p>With those encouraging remarks from the seringueiros,
who were sobbing bitterly, we drifted with the
current, Antonio and Filippe the negro paddling in
the style generally adopted for scooping soup with a
spoon out of a dish.</p>

<p>I had provided the canoe with a number of improvised
paddles we had cut ourselves. There were no
two of equal size, shape, or weight. We had chopped
them with an axe from sections of a tree. They were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-17" id="Pg_2-17"></a>[<a href="./images/2-17.png">17</a>]</span>
originally all intended to be the same, but what we
intended to have and what we got were two different
matters, as the five of us each worked on a separate
paddle.</p>

<p>The seringueiros stood on the high bank, waving
their arms in the air. One of them blew plaintive
sounds on one of the horns used by them for calling
their companions while in the forest. Those horns
could be heard enormous distances. Filippe the white
man, who was not paddling, fired back a salute of ten
shots. There was nothing my men loved more than
to waste ammunition. Fortunately we had plenty.</p>

<p>The average width of the river was there from 80
to 100 metres, with a fairly swift current. It was lucky
that ours was the only boat on that river, for indeed
we needed all that breadth of water in our snake-like
navigation. I remonstrated with Alcides, who was at
the helm, and advised him to keep the nose of the
canoe straight ahead, as we were coming to a <i>corrideira</i>
or small rapid.</p>

<p>Alcides, who could never be told anything, became
enraged at my words of warning, and also at the
derision of the other men, as we were drifting side on
and he could not straighten her course. Just as we
were entering the rapid, in his fury Alcides, in disgust,
let go the steering-gear, which he said was useless.
We were seized by the current and swung round with
some violence, dashing along, scraping the bottom of
the canoe on rocks, and bumping now on one side,
now on the other, until eventually we were dashed
violently over a lot of submerged trees, where the
bank had been eroded by the current and there had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-18" id="Pg_2-18"></a>[<a href="./images/2-18.png">18</a>]</span>
been a landslide. The canoe nearly capsized, the three
dogs and some top baggage being thrown out into the
water by the impact. We got stuck so hard among
the branches of the trees that we all had to remove
our lower garments and get into the water trying to
get the canoe off.</p>

<p>My men used pretty language. That small accident
was lucky for us. The shouts of my men attracted
to the bank a passing man. Half-scared, a
wild figure of a mulatto with long, unkempt hair and
beard, his body covered by what must have once been
a suit of clothes, stood gazing at us, clutching a double-barrelled
gun in his hands.</p>

<p>"Is there a revolution in Matto Grosso?" he
inquired when I caught sight of him. "Why do you
fly the red flag?"</p>

<p>"That is not the flag of revolution, that is the flag
of peace. It is the English flag."</p>

<p>"The English flag! The English flag!" he exclaimed,
running down the slope of the river bank.
"You are English!... Oh, sir, take me with you!
I entreat you take me with you! I am an escaped
slave.... I owe my master much money.... I can
never repay it.... I am a seringueiro. My estrada
is some miles down the river. I have been there alone
suffering for months. I had no more food, nothing.
There is very little fish in the river. The life is too
terrible. I can stand it no more. If you do not take
me with you I shall kill myself."</p>

<p>I tried to persuade the strange figure to return to
his master&mdash;the master lived in comfort in the city
of Cuyab&aacute;. "If you chose to borrow money and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-19" id="Pg_2-19"></a>[<a href="./images/2-19.png">19</a>]</span>
sell yourself, it was only right that you should repay
your debt." That was the only way I could look at it.
But the man would not hear of it. If I did not
take him he would kill himself&mdash;there, before me, he
repeated; that was all.</p>

<p>So difficult a dilemma to solve&mdash;at so inconvenient
a moment, when we were as busy as busy could be,
trying to disentangle the canoe&mdash;was rather tiresome.
The strange man, having laid his gun upon the ground,
helped us with all his might in our work. When the
canoe got off, the strange man, gun and all, jumped
clumsily into her and nearly capsized her a second
time. He implored me with tears in his eyes to take
him along. He would work day and night; he would
present me with his double-barrelled gun (an old
muzzle-loader); he did not want pay&mdash;he only wanted
to get freed from his master, who, he said, robbed and
ill-treated him.</p>

<p>"Do you swear upon all that is most sacred that
you have made up your mind not to go back to your
master?"</p>

<p>"Yes. If you say 'No' to me, I shall kill myself now."</p>

<p>Benedicto&mdash;that was his name&mdash;spoke with quiet
determination.</p>

<p>"Very good, Benedicto. You can remain. What
is more, you shall receive from this moment the same
pay as the other men. You can keep your old gun,
too."</p>

<p>Benedicto embraced and kissed my hands, then
my feet. The poor man's joy was so great that it was
really worth living to see that such moments of happiness
could be procured in a man's lifetime.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-20" id="Pg_2-20"></a>[<a href="./images/2-20.png">20</a>]</span>
Benedicto was a free man again, and for the first
time in his life was earning genuine money! He was
handed a paddle, and he paddled away for all he was
worth, splashing with water those in front and behind
him. He was in a state of great excitement, tears
flowing freely down his cheeks and beard, and dripping
on to his knees as he sat in the bottom of the
canoe. He sobbed to his heart's content, and kept
on splashing us all over with his paddle. We were all
so touched by that pathetic scene that we preferred
getting wet to remonstrating.</p>

<p>Fortunately the river was placid enough under the
<i>corrideira</i>. When things had quieted down a little, I
taught Benedicto and the others how to paddle properly,
and Alcides how to steer straight. I had then
five men. That improved matters greatly, as four
could paddle while the fifth was steering.</p>

<p>The Arinos River flowed from Porto Velho in a
south-westerly, then in a due westerly direction, then
north, then again west, from which last point it doubled,
as it were, and proceeded east and south-east, returning
to within quite a short distance of our original
point of departure. We sounded our horn, and immediately
heard in reply the horn of the seringueiros
at Porto Velho. Judging by the sound, the distance
could not have been more than a few hundred metres,
although we had travelled some six thousand metres
down stream.</p>

<p class="fsc">Enormous Globular Rocks typical of the Arinos River.</p>
<hr />
<p>For the first time I noticed swallows flying swiftly
over the river, close to the water. Another easy
<i>corrideira</i> was encountered. When we had been out
several hours my men were already beginning to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-21" id="Pg_2-21"></a>[<a href="./images/2-21.png">21</a>]</span>
into the right way of paddling, and Alcides was commencing
to understand the capricious mysteries of the
steering-gear.</p>

<p>On account of my men's inexperience&mdash;and due
credit being given to the current&mdash;we went at the rate
of 13 kils. an hour. Innumerable were the rubber
trees all along the banks. Occasionally small sand
beaches were met with. Here and there a fallen giant
tree obstructed part of the river. Families of <i>ariranhas</i>
(<i>Lutra brasiliensis</i>) played in the water. The pretty
little animals&mdash;not unlike otters&mdash;raised their heads
above water, and, hissing loudly, frequently came to
attack the canoe. They were extraordinarily brave.
They were greatly attracted by the vivid red of the
British flag, which in their imagination suggested
blood. They became wildly excited when I waved the
flag at them, and when I placed it near the water they
would charge the canoe&mdash;so much so that two or
three times my men were able to kill them by striking
them on the head with the heavy wooden paddles.</p>

<p>The river was at its lowest when I descended it,
which made it all the more difficult for us, as we were
treated to innumerable small rapids which would otherwise
have been entirely covered over with water. A
great island (80 m. long) of pebbles and beautiful
crystals was passed in the centre of the stream, which
there formed two channels; one entirely blocked by
fallen trees and accumulated rolling material, the other,
40 m. wide, very deep and swift.</p>

<p>The banks of the river were about 20 ft. high,
generally of red earth, with a stratum of white sand
above. The vegetation was luxuriant and extra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-22" id="Pg_2-22"></a>[<a href="./images/2-22.png">22</a>]</span>ordinarily
tidy along the summit of the banks. The
water was quite crystal-like, it was so clear. All the
time our nostrils were fully expanded to inhale the
delicious scent of the forest, which closely resembled
that of jessamine. Masses of violet-coloured convolvuli
were festooned from the trees. That was a great
treat for me, after the months I had gone through
when my entire days were spent eating up dust raised
in clouds by the troop of animals marching in front
of me.</p>

<p>When you came to survey a river it was really
amazing what zigzags water could make in cutting its
way through a country. From north-west the Arinos
veered south-west, and from south-west to north-east.</p>

<p>By one o'clock we were in a spacious basin, 200 m.
in diameter, close to which a small tributary, 2 m.
wide, entered the Arinos on the left bank. Farther
down on the right bank were neat beaches of white
and red sand. We stopped for a few moments at a
seringueiro's shed. The poor fellow&mdash;a negro&mdash;was in
a pitiable condition from malarial fever.</p>

<p>Those martyrs of labour were much to be pitied,
and also admired. There, hundreds of miles away
from everybody, they stayed, abandoned in the forest
until the agents of their masters who had dropped
them there found it convenient to come and fetch
them back again. If they came back at all and never
failed, it was not, you can be sure, for the interest
they took in human life, but because of the quantity
of valuable rubber which they expected would be collected
before their return. Those poor creatures had
no possible way of escape, except under extraordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-23" id="Pg_2-23"></a>[<a href="./images/2-23.png">23</a>]</span>
circumstances. They were conveyed to their stations
overland by means of pack animals, which at once
were sent back and did not return until the end of the
collecting season. Even then, if the seringueiro wanted
to get away, he was frequently compelled to purchase
an animal from his employer at three or four times
its actual value&mdash;that is to say, perhaps sixty or
eighty pounds sterling. So that the more a man
worked or earned the more he became indebted to his
master.</p>

<p>Like all men who have lived a great deal in exile
and solitude, the seringueiros&mdash;nearly all blacks or
mulattos&mdash;were extraordinarily generous. They always
wanted to give you all they possessed&mdash;which was next
to nothing, but meant a fortune to them. They would
deprive themselves of anything if they thought they
could give the slightest pleasure.</p>

<p>We left the seringueiro. I feared the poor man
could not live long in his broken-down condition. He
was most grateful for some medicine and provisions I
left with him. His farewell to us was in so melancholy
a voice, as he tried to lift himself out of an improvised
bamboo couch, that for days it rang in my ears, and
before my eyes constantly remained his skeleton-like,
sunken features as he waved his farewell and fell
back exhausted.</p>

<p>Behind a narrow barrier of sand, about 10 ft. high,
as we proceeded down stream in a north-westerly
direction, was a large lagoon.</p>

<p>The river was really too beautiful for words, the
clear green water reflecting with precision in deeper
tones the view before us. Only when its course was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-24" id="Pg_2-24"></a>[<a href="./images/2-24.png">24</a>]</span>
disturbed and diverted by a sharp rock or by the
branches of a fallen and dying tree, the successive
angular ridges of the troubled water shone like polished
silver in parallel lines from the reflected light of the
sun, just like a huge luminous skeleton of a fish.</p>

<p>The trees were truly wonderful along the river&mdash;tall
and healthy, with dense deep green foliage. But
Nature seemed absolutely asleep. Barring the few
swallows we had seen soon after our departure, and
the <i>ariranhas</i>, we went the whole day without hearing
the song of a bird, or the howling of a wild animal.
We did hear a noise resembling the bark of a dog&mdash;so
much did it resemble it that my dogs barked back.
But it came not from a dog at all. The peculiar noise
was made by a large bird.</p>

<hr />
<p>After passing a handsome beach of white sand on
our left, the river described sharp angles, west, north-west,
north-east, then north. There were rapids, fairly
strong, although not dangerous in any way. The river
was forced through a channel 50 m. wide, in which
the current was very strong. To make things worse,
a giant tree had fallen and obstructed much of the
passage, compelling us to negotiate the rapid in its
worst part. A large bay, 180 m. in diameter, opened
out below that point. Farther came a perfectly
straight stretch of water for 3,000 m. Halfway down
that stretch, to the right, we passed the mouth of the
Agua Clara, a charming rivulet of crystalline water,
10 m. wide. A conglomerate stratum of alluvial
formation, composed of well-rounded pebbles held together
by red earth, and crumbling easily under pressure
of the fingers, showed through in many places.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-25" id="Pg_2-25"></a>[<a href="./images/2-25.png">25</a>]</span>
The beaches of handsome, fine white sand were most
interesting.</p>

<p>The forest was getting thin on both sides. In fact,
late in the afternoon we had open country on the
left bank&mdash;only a few trees being visible near the
water's edge, and an occasional giant <i>jatob&aacute;</i> (<i>Hymencoea
Courbaril</i> L.), the latter chiefly on the right bank.
The right bank was sparsely wooded, and at one time
we had open campos on both sides of us.</p>

<p>A streamlet 3 m. wide entered the Arinos on the
left. We got to one point where the river proved
treacherous, although apparently almost tranquil on
the surface. The Brazilians have an excellent name
for such places&mdash;<i>rebojo</i>, or a curve formed by sudden
deviation of a current. If we had not been careful
in going across such places, it would have been easy
for the canoe to have been turned over and sucked
under.</p>

<p>Patches of thick forest were met on either bank,
and in those patches numerous indeed were the rubber
trees. In the afternoon we saw chiefly campos and
<i>chapada</i>, or thin scrub.</p>

<p>Considering all, we did well&mdash;chiefly owing to the
strong current&mdash;on our first day of navigation. We
had gone some 70 kils. when we halted at sunset, at
the junction of the very deep streamlet Quarustera
with the Arinos. The elevation of our camp, 60 ft.
above the river, was 1,200 ft.</p>

<p>The nights were cool enough&mdash;minimum 55&deg; Fahr.
on the night of June 6th&mdash;7th. There was a thick haze
over the river in the morning, and as we did not
know what we might be coming upon suddenly we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-26" id="Pg_2-26"></a>[<a href="./images/2-26.png">26</a>]</span>
did not make a start until 7.15. After crossing a
large and shallow bay the stream was forced into a
channel 50 m. wide. There was open country&mdash;campos&mdash;on
the right bank. A curious isolated volcanic
boulder split in two was then observed in the stream,
while the banks were of alluvially deposited conglomerate.
From that spot luxuriant forest was on the
right bank once more, while open country was on
the left. Upon examination I found that the thick
forest was merely a band or zone near the water&mdash;behind
was open country.</p>

<p>Farther, the river went through a neck 40 m. wide
where the current was very swift. The banks almost
all along were from 10 to 20 ft. high. Slender <i>tucuma</i>
or <i>tucuman</i> palms were to be seen, which had stems only
3 to 4 in. in diameter, but were 30 to 40 ft. high,
and had a ball-like tuft of leaves at the top. We then
came upon open country (<i>chapada</i>) on both sides,
and went over small <i>corrideiras</i>, which we got to like,
as we travelled along on them at a greater speed than
in the still waters, with a minimum of exertion. The
river seemed to be getting narrower all the time that
day, and, of course, deeper. In many spots it went
through a channel not more than 30 m. wide.</p>

<p>We heard&mdash;but not for long&mdash;the cackling of the
<i>jacu</i> (<i>Penelope cristata</i>), a handsome gallinaceous bird.
The <i>jacu</i> made most delicious eating. Then that day
flocks of small green parrots flew over our heads on
several occasions.</p>

<p><i>Ariranhas</i> gave us once more a good deal of amusement
and sport. It was seldom one found such
cheeky and inquisitive animals. They would pop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-27" id="Pg_2-27"></a>[<a href="./images/2-27.png">27</a>]</span>
their heads out of the water quite close to the canoe and
sniff and grind their teeth at us. They had beautiful
little heads&mdash;something between a cat and a seal&mdash;with
lovely, but wicked, black eyes of wonderful
luminosity. They had a perfect craving for blood.
The Brazilians have strange tales about them&mdash;not
exactly fit for publication.</p>

<p>The sand beaches were not so frequent as we
advanced on our journey. We noticed instead extensive
beaches of gravel. Another tributary stream,
10 m. wide at its mouth, entered the Arinos from the
east. There was heavy forest there with plenty of
rubber-trees on the right bank, whereas the country
was open on the left bank.</p>

<p>Farther down, the banks became low, so that
the slightest rise in the river would inundate the
country. The forest was particularly thick, and the
rubber trees plentiful, along a stretch of 4,300 m. of
river in a perfectly straight line.</p>

<p>The river was getting more and more beautiful at
every turn. We emerged into a bay 300 m. in diameter.
Great blocks of conglomerate were strewn
about. A great spur projected to the centre of
the bay. The richness in rubber of that region was
amazing. Wonderful giant trees, heavily laden with
dark green foliage, were reflected in deeper tones in the
water of the river&mdash;there almost stagnant because
held up by some obstacle lower down. Innumerable
festoons of creepers hung down from those trees. The
stream was there 80 m. wide, and beautiful that day
in great stretches of 4,300 m., 1,400 m., 1,000 m.,
3,000 m., 1,500 m., and 1,200 m.&mdash;in a perfectly straight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-28" id="Pg_2-28"></a>[<a href="./images/2-28.png">28</a>]</span>
line. The forest was occasionally interrupted on one
side or the other by great expanses of <i>chapada</i>.</p>

<p>Immense <i>bacabeira</i> palms, 40 to 50 ft. high, were
numerous, most graceful to look at, with their ten or
eleven huge compound leaves placed like an open fan.
Yellow filaments of some length hung in a cluster
where the petiole of the leaves met.</p>

<p>We arrived at a <i>pedreria</i>&mdash;an accumulation of rocks&mdash;extending
almost right across the stream, and which
was the cause of the placidity of the waters above it.
There were two channels&mdash;one to bearings magnetic
330&deg;, the other to 360&deg;&mdash;on either side of a central
island. We followed the first and larger channel. The
island, which had a most luxuriant growth of trees
upon it, was subdivided into two by a channel 10 m.
wide at its south-eastern end.</p>

<p>For purposes of identification I named all the
islands we saw. The larger of these two I called
Esmeralda Island. In order to establish its exact
position I landed and took observations for latitude
and longitude. Lat. 13&deg; 15&#8242;&middot;6 S.; long. 56&deg; 46&#8242; W.</p>

<p>We were then at an elevation of 1,150 ft. The
temperature in the shade was 77&deg; Fahr. and 98&deg; in
the sun. Six-tenths of the sky was covered with
thick globular clouds, which made the air heavy,
although the temperature was not excessively high.
It must be remembered that we in the canoe were
in the sun all the time and suffered a good deal in
the morning and afternoon, when the sun was not
high, by the refraction of the sun's rays from the
water. The refracted light was so powerful that it
interfered a good deal with the navigation. The river<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-29" id="Pg_2-29"></a>[<a href="./images/2-29.png">29</a>]</span>
looked like a molten surface of boiling silver, which
absolutely blinded us at times, and made it impossible
to see what was ahead in the water.</p>

<p>Esmeralda Island was formerly joined at its most
south-westerly point to the western bank of the
river. From that point the river described an arc of a
circle as far as bearings magnetic 20&deg; (N.N.E.). We
negotiated successfully two small rapids with large
volcanic rocks just under the surface of the water. We
just escaped going over one of them, which would
have certainly capsized the canoe. As it was we
merely scraped the side of the canoe against it.</p>

<p>The left bank, which had crumbled down, showed
strata of conglomerate and yellow sand, with upper
alluvial deposits of a light grey colour.</p>

<p>We were travelling due north in a straight line
of 1,800 m. when we came upon the entrance of a lakelet
on the west side of an islet. A huge fish&mdash;some
5 ft. in length&mdash;unaccustomed to the unusual sight of
human beings, played about under our canoe for some
time, much to the excitement of my men. Birds
of superb metallic blue, vivid yellow, and iridescent
plumage played about among the trees. On the left
bank farther down was a great growth of high bamboos,
then again forest with plenty of vigorous rubber trees.</p>

<p>Again small and fairly swift rapids were encountered
in a turn of the river from bearings magnetic
70&deg; to 250&deg;. A tributary stream which came from
the south entered the Arinos on its left bank.
Then we came to another island forming two
channels&mdash;one (N.W.) 20 m. wide, with some rough-looking
rapids; the other channel (N.), larger and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-30" id="Pg_2-30"></a>[<a href="./images/2-30.png">30</a>]</span>
shallower, divided in its turn in two by a mound
of yellow gravel.</p>

<p>Alcides, who steered, had an idea that in going
down rapids you should always send the canoe over
places where the water broke and foamed, which meant
rocks underneath, and not keep her in the centre of
the channel where the water was deeper. This idea
was, I think, suggested by his inability to swim, and
the hope that if we got wrecked he could touch bottom
with his feet, so that his life might be in comparative
safety. I tried to argue the point with him, but it
was no use. It invariably led to such unpleasantness
that once more I decided to trust in Providence, as
long as we went forward.</p>

<p>I had just shouted to Alcides to keep in the centre
of the channel. Of course he disobeyed. We were
caught in the strong current. One moment later there
was a violent bump which knocked us all off our seats
and sent us sprawling in the bottom of the canoe.
We had stuck fast between two rocks. The canoe,
being of such great length, vibrated to and fro with the
current forcing it at the side. Laden as she was with
baggage, in a few moments she became filled with
water, and it was only after working hard for the best
part of an hour that we were able to extricate ourselves
from our position. We had hardly finished
baling the water out on resuming our course than,
1,500 m. farther, we came to more rapids, then 700 m.
beyond yet other rapids.</p>

<p>The forest was fairly thick all along on both banks,
with innumerable healthy rubber trees. Although the
forest seemed impenetrable at first sight, I always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-31" id="Pg_2-31"></a>[<a href="./images/2-31.png">31</a>]</span>
found that it was easy enough to go through it if one
knew how. Quite close to the water naturally the
vegetation was somewhat entangled. In many places
were extensive patches of bamboos of considerable
height; but there is a way of disentangling the
most confused growth, if you happen to understand
how those plants and liane grow and get twisted.
Any one with a keen sense of observation should experience
no difficulty whatever in going through the
densest forest anywhere in the world&mdash;even without
using a knife&mdash;although, of course, the latter is useful
when you wish to keep up a certain speed in your
marching.</p>

<p>Eleven kilometres and a half from the last rapids&mdash;having
travelled north-west, south-west, east, and
even due south, so winding was the course of the river&mdash;we
came to a tributary stream 10 m. wide, on the
left side of the Arinos. Eight kilometres farther we
passed the inlet&mdash;then dry&mdash;of a small lagoon fed by
the stream. The river banks, where eroded by the
water, showed a lower layer of reddish-brown rock with
a bright red ferruginous stratum above it. The top
layer, 10 ft. thick, seemed formed of lime and alluvial
deposits.</p>

<p>We emerged into a large basin 200 m. across, with
a charming little island in the centre forming two
channels with fairly strong rapids. We followed the
channel on the right. At that point the river folded
over itself into a great elbow. A cliff, 120 ft. high,
towered on one side in brilliant red and yellow. The
lower half of the strata was perfectly horizontal; the
upper half at an angle of 45&deg; to the lower. The vivid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-32" id="Pg_2-32"></a>[<a href="./images/2-32.png">32</a>]</span>
colouring was intensified by contrast with a beautiful
beach of immaculate white sand on the left side of the
great elbow.</p>

<p>I observed a wonderful double lunar halo on the
night of July 7-8, the outer circle in successive tints
of most delicate yellow, orange, pale blue and white&mdash;the
yellow being nearest the centre.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were rather proud of ourselves, as we had gone
69 kils. on July 7th, paddling away&mdash;barring the interval
for lunch&mdash;from 7.15 in the morning until 7.30
at night.</p>

<p>The night was fairly cold&mdash;minimum 57&deg; Fahr.;
the elevation 1,100 ft. Where I made camp at the
elbow of the stream (on the left bank) there were innumerable
rubber trees. A similar wealth of <i>Siphonia
elastica</i> appeared to be on the opposite bank, where the
forest was luxuriant.</p>

<p>On July 8th we began our journey by going down
rapids. Then after some 15,300 m. of fairly smooth
navigation we crossed a basin 130 m. wide, where we
encountered strong eddies&mdash;most unpleasant, as they
swerved the canoe about in a way that was alarming.
Lower down a swift <i>corrideira</i> and more eddies gave
us some trouble.</p>

<p>A beautiful <i>ariranha</i> peeped out of the water close
to the canoe, spitting angrily at us. It was attracted
by the blood-red of the English flag, which it evidently
wanted to bite. My men fired and wounded it; but
so vicious were those little otters, and so great their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-34" id="Pg_2-34"></a>[<a href="./images/2-34.png">34</a>]</span>
craving for blood, that it still came on to within a
foot or two of the canoe, when my men killed it.</p>

<p>The river was there compressed into a deep channel,
85 m. wide, with a strong current, after which it split
into two arms&mdash;one north-west, 25 m. wide; the other
north-east, 30 m. broad. The island thus formed between
the two arms was 2,500 m. long. We called it
Ariranha Island.</p>

<p>A streamlet 3 m. wide entered the Arinos on the
right bank. Where the banks were free from vegetation
an undulating stratum of red earth was exposed,
directly above which was a stratum from 1 to 2 ft.
thick of a brilliant yellow colour. Above that rested
the usual grey alluvial deposits from 6 to 8 ft. thick.</p>

<p>From a direction due west the stream suddenly
turned north, between high banks. A strong <i>corrideira</i>
was found before the stream divided itself into
three arms&mdash;two of those arms flowing north-east, the
other north-west. We followed the latter&mdash;a channel
20 m. wide, with a high bank of gravel on its left side.
Where those arms met again&mdash;some 500 m. farther&mdash;a
basin 200 m. in diameter was formed. A hill 150 ft.
high, covered with dense vegetation, faced us to the
north. It was quite an unusual sight in such flat
country. The stream took a sharp turn at that spot&mdash;it
positively doubled. Strong eddies were encountered.
The greatest care should have been taken in
going over places of that kind, but "care" was a
word I had absolutely scratched out of my vocabulary
as useless in my journey across Brazil. How and why
we ever got across those places with the crew I had
on board, would indeed be beyond me to explain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-35" id="Pg_2-35"></a>[<a href="./images/2-35.png">35</a>]</span>&mdash;unless,
as on preceding occasions, it was due to the
unceasing protection of a guardian angel.</p>

<p>After crossing a circular basin 200 m. in diameter,
the river became suddenly squeezed into a channel
30 m. wide, much strewn with rocks. A somewhat
troublesome rapid had to be negotiated there, rendered
more difficult by the recent fall, across the best part
of the stream, of a giant tree. The branches which
stuck out of the water formed a regular barrier and
waved to and fro with the violent pressure of the
water. Before we could realize where we were, Alcides
steered us straight into the branches and foliage of the
fallen tree. As we were travelling at an accelerated
speed with the strong current, all our hats were scraped
off our heads, and, what was worse, our scalps, faces,
and arms had patches of skin torn off as we crashed
among the branches. It took us some time before we
were able to disentangle ourselves, resume navigation,
and recover as we went along the various headgear
floating independently down the stream.</p>

<p>Another little tributary, 2 m. wide, entered the
Arinos on the left side. No sooner had we freed ourselves
from the rapids than we were in a circle 80 m.
across, with nasty-looking eddies, which swung the
undermanned canoe now to one side, then violently
to the other, in a dangerous way. We could not have
struck a worse time for navigating the river. It was
then the end of the dry season and the water at its
lowest, so that every possible obstacle that could be
found in that river stood to impede our progress. This
would not have been the case at high water when
navigation in that portion of the stream would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-36" id="Pg_2-36"></a>[<a href="./images/2-36.png">36</a>]</span>
been comparatively smooth and easy. We were thanking
our stars that we had passed the vicious eddies
safely, when we were confronted by more rapids,
with treacherous submerged rocks. Yet another basin,
150 m. wide, was crossed, with large blocks of black
rock showing through on the left bank. More rapids
were met&mdash;quite easy to negotiate. The sky was half
covered with feathery radiations from the south.</p>

<p>To the north another hill, 120 ft. high, eroded by
water, stood on the left bank of the stream, where red
volcanic rock was also visible in a stratum 15 ft. thick,
covered by a thick layer of yellow earth. Strong rapids
came next. We had had so much luck in the descent
of the rapids&mdash;which, bad as they were, really were so
far quite unimportant as compared to what we were
to find later&mdash;that my men began to be quite adventurous.
Saving trifling mishaps, we were getting
on well. The tributaries of the Arinos we had seen so
far that day were small streamlets 1 m. wide on the
right; another, 2 m. wide&mdash;a limpid stream&mdash;coming
from the south-west on the left. Several springs of
clear water filtered through the left bank. In the
centre of the river was an extensive bank of gravel
held up by blocks of volcanic rock.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Cataract on the Arinos River.</p>
<hr />
<p>In a basin 150 m. wide rose a pretty island. Rapids
were found in the channels, of which the western was
wider and more free from obstacles. For one entire
kilometre there were strong eddies and rapids in succession;
then came 3,500 m. of fairly easy travelling.
The river for 23,500 m. had been flowing almost in a
straight line due north, with slight variations of a few
degrees to the north-east and once to the north-west.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-37" id="Pg_2-37"></a>[<a href="./images/2-37.png">37</a>]</span>
Plenty of <i>tucum</i> or <i>tucuma</i> palms adorned the right
bank; whereas on the left bank was fairly open
country.</p>

<p>Again, after some more rapids, the river was
squeezed into a neck only 25 m. wide, gradually widening
to some 150 m., where whirlpools and eddies of
considerable magnitude were formed. On several
occasions the canoe was caught in them and swerved
right round, describing one or more circles upon herself.
Two islets were passed, then a tributary 10 m.
wide coming from the east on the right side of us.</p>

<p>A great number of submerged rocks close to the
surface formed a ridge 200 m. in length all along the
centre of the stream. In a wonderful stretch 4,000 m.
long in a perfectly straight line north, the river was
from 50 to 100 m. wide. A small tributary rivulet
entered it on the west. At the end of that long stretch
a wall, 100 ft. high, of brilliantly yellow rock in its
lower part, with 15 ft. of vivid red rock above, diverted
the stream almost at a right angle toward the west.
Rapids and eddies were encountered after passing an
obstruction of accumulated gravel in the centre of the
river, there 50 m. wide.</p>

<p>Giant trees, not unlike weeping willows, bent over
the river, their streamers touching the water. A rocky
barrier extended as far as the centre of the stream,
leaving only one safe passage on the left side close to
the bank. The stream was at that point 100 m.
broad, and of great beauty, in a straight line north for
7,400 m.</p>

<p>My men were beginning to paddle a little better,
and we were travelling at a considerable speed with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-38" id="Pg_2-38"></a>[<a href="./images/2-38.png">38</a>]</span>
the current. We had glorious weather, and although
the heat was great our travelling was perfectly delightful.
In the daytime we were not worried much by
insects. The canoe now and then stuck fast in shallow
places or upon rocks, but we all jumped gaily into
the water and pushed her along until she floated again.
Those baths in the deliciously clear water were quite
refreshing. We generally jumped in clothes and all,
and left it to the sun to dry the garments upon our
backs and legs. I usually wore pyjamas while travelling
in the canoe, as they were more comfortable than
other clothes and dried quicker when we came out of
the water again.</p>

<p>Many sharp successive turns were met next in the
course of the river, which then showed stunted vegetation
on the right bank and thick forest on the left. A
high natural wall, 100 ft. high, of bright cadmium
yellow for 30 ft. in its lower part, of vivid red for 50 ft.
above that, and darker red above, barred our way
in front (north). On its summit were peculiar white-barked
slender trees&mdash;so white that they looked almost
as if they had been painted, but of course they had
not. The entire centre of the river, forming there an
extensive basin, was blocked by a high bank of gravel,
leaving merely narrow channels close to the banks.
The high wall deflected the stream from 290&deg; to bearings
magnetic 30&deg;. A range of hills some 300 ft. high
then appeared before us, extending from N.N.W. to
S.S.E.</p>

<p>We went over a stony place which obstructed
almost the entire river, except a narrow channel
close to the banks. That was followed by rapids.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-39" id="Pg_2-39"></a>[<a href="./images/2-39.png">39</a>]</span>
Some 2 kil. 300 m. farther, a hill range to the north
switched the stream sharply from north to north-west,
which direction it kept with a mere deviation of 20&deg;
for 6,500 m.</p>

<p>The stream was then 100 metres wide nearly all
along, and of amazing beauty. Yet another stony place
disturbed the placidity of the transparent crystal-like
water. At the end of that wonderful stretch of river
came another great vertical wall, on the left side&mdash;of
most brilliant colouring, a stratum of vivid red 60 ft.
deep with thin bright horizontal yellow streaks, and an
upper stratum 18 ft. thick of a similar dazzling yellow.
The northern portion of the cliff differed in colouring,
and had a brown lower stratum 30 ft. thick, followed
upwards by a yellow stratum 2 ft. thick, and a red
stratum&mdash;a most brilliant vermilion&mdash;15 ft. thick.
Above was a pink layer 15 ft. thick and a summit
deposit of brown earth 45 ft. deep. There again the
river was shifted by that obstacle from b.m. 290&deg; to
due north. A charming island&mdash;which I baptized
Bridget Island&mdash;700 m. long and 100 m. wide, absolutely
smothered in vegetation, was found there. It
had an extensive spur of yellow sand and gravel. The
right bank was sparsely wooded with open country
behind. Two channels were found, one flowing north-west,
40 m. wide, the other north-east, 30 m. broad.
We followed the latter, where the rapids seemed less
fearsome than in the broader channel.</p>

<p>At the end of Bridget Island another island, 500 m.
long, was found, which we called Lucky Island. This
second island was 200 m. down stream from the first,
and was situated at the junction of the River dos Patos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-40" id="Pg_2-40"></a>[<a href="./images/2-40.png">40</a>]</span>
("river of ducks") with the River Arinos on the right
side of the latter stream.</p>

<p>We were amazed to see opposite the island on the
right bank a fishing tackle and some clothes. As we
had already gone 89 kil. 850 m. that day, having kept
an average speed of 11 kil. 250 m. an hour, and the
sun was about to set, we decided to halt on "Lucky
Island" for the night. We were busy preparing our
dinner when a strange figure appeared on the right
bank, rifle in hand. His astonishment at seeing us
was no greater than ours at seeing him.</p>

<p>"Who were we?" "Where did we come from?"
"What did we want there?" "Where were we going?"</p>

<p>All those questions having been duly answered, I
sent my canoe over to ferry the fellow across. He
was one of the queerest men I have ever met. His
eyes constantly roamed about like those of a wild
feline animal. He never kept still a moment, springing
up unexpectedly to his feet when he was sitting
down, and squatting himself down when he had been
standing up. All the time he was handling his rifle&mdash;a
very handsome one&mdash;and with rapid movements
watched intently now one then another of our party.
He seemed in a state of great nervous strain and
excitement. He appeared to be a first or second
cross of Indians and negroes&mdash;quite young, some
twenty-four years of age. He had very little clothing
upon his person, which showed limbs of extraordinary
muscular strength. Seldom is it given to one to see
so cruel a face, seldom were criminal characteristics so
clearly marked on any one's countenance and in the
formation of the skull. A man with a face like that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-41" id="Pg_2-41"></a>[<a href="./images/2-41.png">41</a>]</span>
could be capable of any crime. His conversation
supplied ample further testimony that his physiognomy
had not deceived me. I had so far thought that my
men were the coarsest, the most brutal individuals I
had ever met, but they were not in it at all with the
strange figure we had before us. The conversation of
my men had seemed to me disgustingly vulgar, but it
now appeared the acme of refinement when the new
man opened his mouth to talk. Good gracious me!
what extraordinary oaths&mdash;what perversion of ideas&mdash;what
foaming hatred for the Creator, our Saviour,
all the saints imaginable, and humanity in general!
Evidently the poor man had a screw loose somewhere
within his brain-case.</p>

<p>I gave him some tobacco, a quantity of which I
carried for my men. Without a word of acknowledgment
he seized it, and, with paper my men gave him,
proceeded to make himself a cigarette.</p>

<p>"I am tired of this life," said he, as he rolled the
tobacco. "I am a slave. I owe my master 1 conto
200 milreis (&pound;80). He sold me this rifle, and some
cartridges, and I cannot repay him. I am rotting
away with fever. I am dying of starvation, I am
going mad in this place.... I have no more food, and
have been unable for three days to catch fish. Do not
let me die here. Take me with you. I will give you
my rifle, this ring"&mdash;a cheap ring which he proceeded
to take from his finger&mdash;"I shall work hard and require
no pay if you will save me from death."</p>

<p>I told him that he had better consider his position
seriously before doing anything rash. We should not
be leaving until the next morning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-42" id="Pg_2-42"></a>[<a href="./images/2-42.png">42</a>]</span>
The man, whom we shall call X, as I do not wish
to divulge his real name, sat up the entire night talking
to my men. His excitement was great&mdash;at least,
judging by the loudness of his voice. During those
long sleepless hours&mdash;with all of them shouting at the
top of their voices it was impossible to sleep&mdash;I overheard
the entire history of his life. What a life! I
prayed my stars that X would change his mind and
decide to stay where he was, for though I needed extra
men badly I feared that his company would not be a
welcome addition to our party, bad as it was. Like
all men who have lived much in seclusion, he possessed
marvellous vitality and magnetism. My men were
simply hypnotised by the remarkable tales of his deeds,
or rather misdeeds.</p>

<p>Long before we were ready to start, X went to
seat himself in the canoe to make sure we should not
leave him behind. When I asked him to reconsider
once more what he was doing, which was not fair to
his master, no matter how bad he may have been, X
positively refused to remain there.</p>

<p>"If you do not want me to come," he said with
determination, "you will have to fling me into the
water and keep my head under until I am drowned."</p>

<p>That was rather a trying dilemma. Much as I
disapprove of slavery, I did not like the idea of taking
matters into my own hands and freeing other people's
slaves; yet it was impossible to refuse assistance to
a suffering man when he asked for it. In any case I
had no wish to be responsible for his death.</p>

<p>"X," I said to him, "you have quite made up
your mind to go with us?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-43" id="Pg_2-43"></a>[<a href="./images/2-43.png">43</a>]</span>
"Yes."</p>

<p>"Will you promise faithfully that you will work
and give no trouble?"</p>

<p>"May my old father and mother be struck by
lightning this moment if I shall give you trouble!"
was his reply.</p>

<p>"Very good, X. You can keep your rifle and
cartridges and your ring"&mdash;he had just deposited
them at my feet&mdash;"they are your own property. I
do not want them. You shall receive the same salary
as the other men from this day as long as you do your
work satisfactorily."</p>

<p>X jumped out of the canoe to embrace me. On
his brutal face was for a moment an expression of
gratitude ... he rested his head upon my shoulder
and sobbed for many minutes.</p>

<p>With a crew of six men, things were a little better
for us. Four could paddle while one steered, and the
sixth stood on the prow with a long pole punting, or
on the look-out for dangerous obstacles.</p>

<p>X paddled with such vigour that Alcides at the
helm had the greatest difficulty in keeping the canoe
straight. It had a good effect on the other men, who
also paddled away with all their might, and we were
speeding along with the strong current almost as fast
as a steam launch.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature during the night (July
8th-9th) had been 57&deg; Fahr. The elevation above
the sea level of Lucky Island was 1,100 ft.</p>

<p>The River dos Patos came from the S.S.E., then
bent to the east where its sources were.</p>

<p>Lucky Island was 250 m. in length. The river had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-44" id="Pg_2-44"></a>[<a href="./images/2-44.png">44</a>]</span>
an average width of 80 m. As we went along my
men sang gaily, particularly X, who seemed like a
bird let out of its cage, so happy did he feel at being
a free man again. His r&eacute;pertoire was not of the
choicest kind, but what was lacking in quality was
made up in quantity. For some hours we were
treated to a vocal concert, X's solos sending my men
into fits of merriment. His wit&mdash;of the crudest kind&mdash;was
sometimes funny.</p>

<p>This great gaiety seemed most weird in that region
where silence reigned supreme always. The voices
seemed to travel immense distances, echoed from one
side to the other of the river. Words were reproduced
with great clearness by the echo two or three times
over. Especially when we had forest on both sides of
the stream was the echo particularly perfect.</p>

<p>Quantities of rubber trees&mdash;absolutely going to
waste&mdash;were to be seen now on one side, then on the
other, of the river where the banks were wooded.</p>

<p class="fsc">Taking the Canoe through a Narrow Channel.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another most beautiful island, 800 m. long and
80 m. wide&mdash;Pedro de Toledo Island&mdash;was passed. It
had a channel 10 m. wide in a north-westerly direction,
another, which we followed, 50 m. broad, north-east.
On emerging from this channel at the end of the island
we were in a basin 140 m. in diameter. Some 3 kils.
farther, another great basin was crossed&mdash;very shallow,
only 2 ft. deep&mdash;with a gravel bottom. The current
was swift. Then, 2 kils. beyond, yet another basin,
100 metres wide, 1&frac12; ft. deep, with strong eddies, was
crossed. The river, which had so far kept more or
less in a northerly direction, at that point actually
swung round in two consecutive angles from 350&deg;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-45" id="Pg_2-45"></a>[<a href="./images/2-45.png">45</a>]</span>
north to due south, in which direction it flowed for
1,000 m. An immaculately white beach was on the
right of us, on which we duly stranded. It was quite
enough for Alcides to see an obstacle of any kind in
the river for him to send the canoe right over it. I
seized that opportunity to land and commence a most
interesting collection of the innumerable minute sand
plants which were to be found on those beaches.</p>

<p>Where the river turned north once more there
stood a hill 100 ft. high, the lower half of which was
of red volcanic rock, the upper half of yellow earth.
Along the water's edge a thick and florid growth of
bamboo could be seen in many places, while on the
edge of the forest hung myriads of purple convolvuli.
For hundreds of kilometres the Arinos was indeed one
of the most ideally beautiful rivers I have ever seen.
Its banks of alluvial formation, 25 to 30 ft. high, had
<i>chapada</i> on their tops. Farther on the <i>chapada</i> gave
way once more to dense forest with plentiful rubber
trees. Another basin, 150 m. in diameter, was met
with, after which we entered a channel from 40 to 50 m.
wide, through which the stream was compressed.</p>

<p>A pretty little islet of gravel, 100 m. long, 20 m.
wide, and rising 6 ft. above the water, had a tuft of
trees growing on it, and a spur, also of gravel, extending
westward for more than another 100 m. The river in
that section flowed in a W.N.W. direction for 1,400 m.</p>

<p>We soon after came to a shallow basin (1 ft. deep)
100 m. wide, in which eddies were strong and troublesome.
There were many pointed rocks scattered about
in its bed of gravel, as well as three parallel rocky
barriers right across the basin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-46" id="Pg_2-46"></a>[<a href="./images/2-46.png">46</a>]</span>
A rivulet 2 m. wide at the mouth entered the
Arinos on the right side, while on the left side we had
an island 800 m. long, leaving two channels, one 10 m.
wide, the other 40 m. A tiny streamlet flowed into
the main stream on the left. Banks, regular dunes of
gravel, were formed where the river broadened into
basins. We came to a basin 400 m. wide and extremely
shallow. Three channels&mdash;W.N.W., N.W., and N.N.E.&mdash;were
formed in the river by two islands, each 400 m.
long&mdash;the Two Sisters Islands&mdash;which were in the
centre. We found the N.N.E. channel the best.
Where the river narrowed again to a width of 50 m.
huge rocks stood in the centre. From that point for
some 300 m. we went over a succession of gravel banks
and nasty rocks forming barriers across the stream.</p>

<p>Small streamlets entered the Arinos, one on the left,
the other on the right. A cluster of high rocks was
on the right bank. On both sides were extensive
white sand beaches. The river soon widened to 100 m.
in a basin with an islet 12 ft. high, and a cluster of
trees on its north-east side. Another island 6 ft. high,
80 m. long&mdash;Mosquito Island&mdash;with a spit of gravel
to the south, was near it.</p>

<p>Rubber trees were most plentiful on the right bank
where the forest was thick, whereas on the left bank
was <i>chapada</i>. Huge gorgeous butterflies with black-striped
brown wings and velvety bodies flew in great
numbers around the canoe. Some settled on my hat,
hands, and on the sleeves of my white shirt. They
were so unaccustomed to see human beings that when
touched they did not attempt to fly away.</p>

<p>The river was getting more and more wonderful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-47" id="Pg_2-47"></a>[<a href="./images/2-47.png">47</a>]</span>
every hour as we went along&mdash;in great straight lines
of 3,500 m., 3,000 m., 2,200 m., 2,000 m., 4,000 m., in
length.</p>

<p>Some ducks rose from the water only a few yards
in front of the canoe. The man who was behind me
fired with his carbine close to my head. The bullet
grazed my right ear. It was a trifle trying to be
travelling with such careless sportsmen, but the best
thing was to say nothing and go on.</p>

<p>A big island&mdash;Passos Island&mdash;300 m. long, preceded
by a smaller islet 80 m. long&mdash;Passos Junior I.&mdash;was
subsequently passed, where the river formed a channel
(N.W.) 50 m. wide and a minor one (W.) 30 m.</p>

<p>The river there changed from a westerly course to
W.S.W. Once more we had before us a great wall
of red rock which at first seemed to bar our way. In
the lower section of the wall was a cave eroded by
water and extending some way back. It was too low
to be entered by the canoe. The lower stratum of the
wall was at an angle&mdash;in other words, had a dip of 21&deg;&mdash;while
the stratum above it, 30 ft. in thickness, intersected
by a yellow band, was perfectly horizontal.
On the left side of this high natural wall was a charming
waterfall of limpid water. Farther on a great
land-slip displayed for a length of 40 m. brilliant red
earth over a stratum 60 ft. thick of white chalk. The
river, which described a number of turns, was bordered
on the left side by a hill range covered with handsome
trees.</p>

<p>The ardour of my men for rowing had already
passed away. They smoked and sang the whole time,
and let the current&mdash;fortunately strong&mdash;carry us along.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-48" id="Pg_2-48"></a>[<a href="./images/2-48.png">48</a>]</span>
Whenever I remonstrated they scooped the water
carelessly with their paddles for a few minutes. As
is the case with individuals mentally deficient, everything
seemed to distract them. One moment it was
the flight of a <i>jacutinga</i>&mdash;a handsome black gallinaceous
bird with a white crest. Another moment it was the
jump of an inquisitive fish. Many <i>mergulh&atilde;o commun</i>
(<i>Podiceps Americanus</i>), wonderfully graceful, velvety
black birds with long beaks, flew about unconcerned
from tree to tree. Whenever anything moved about
anywhere, the paddles were abandoned, the rifles were
seized, and there was a regular fusillade. The men
seldom hit anything, although on many occasions,
with the unsteady canoe, we all of us had narrow
escapes. One day the man in front of me fired a shot
at a bird&mdash;but so close to my head, not more than one
foot away, that the concussion blinded me for several
seconds. On other occasions the rifles went off when
they were not expected to. I had ceased to give
orders of any kind about the careful use of the weapons.
It was time and lung-power absolutely wasted, and
only made things worse.</p>

<p>After floating down a beautiful stretch of 3,000 m.,
two more islands were reached within a great circle
over 200 m. wide. A small tributary entered the
Arinos on the right bank. Another island, 500 m.
long, was seen farther down, at the end of which, where
two channels met again, violent eddies were produced
by the meeting of the two strong currents.</p>

<p>Immense quantities of <i>Siphonia elastica</i> were there
to be seen on both sides of the stream in the forest,
which was getting more and more luxuriant as we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-49" id="Pg_2-49"></a>[<a href="./images/2-49.png">49</a>]</span>
proceeded on our journey farther north. Many wild
banana palms (<i>bananeira do matto</i>) were to be seen
here and there along the lovely, deliciously clean river,
with its extraordinarily tidy banks.</p>

<p>Another great basin, 300 m. in diameter, was met,
with three islands and two gravel beaches in its centre.
The two principal islands&mdash;Paolo and Francesca&mdash;were
each 100 m. long and 50 m. wide.</p>

<p>We now made the acquaintance of the <i>capivara</i>
(<i>Hydrochoerus capibara</i>), a rodent which we found
common farther down in those waters. It was a stupid
animal. When fired at several times by my men it
remained perfectly still, gazing at its enemies. It
was only when a bullet hit the ground too near that it
would move away, surprised more than concerned.</p>

<p>After going down a <i>corrideira</i> (small rapid) we encountered
thousands of white and lemon-yellow butterflies.
On islets of red earth swarms of them were
basking in the sun&mdash;which was getting hotter and
hotter as we got farther north.</p>

<p>Again we were soon after faced by a high natural
wall of brilliant yellow and red colouring. In its
western part it showed a white stratum 3 ft. thick
upon a layer of yellow lava of an equal thickness. A
stratum of lighter yellow was nearest the surface of
the water, while above was a thick layer of grey earth.
On the right side, at this point, a tributary streamlet
flowed into the Arinos. The basin formed by the
crescent-shaped wall was perfectly circular. When the
river emerged from it, it folded back from 40&deg; b.m.
to 290&deg;.</p>

<p>Owing to the steepness of the banks we experienced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-50" id="Pg_2-50"></a>[<a href="./images/2-50.png">50</a>]</span>
difficulty in finding a suitable camping place for the
night. Eventually at sunset we had to clear with
our big knives a patch in the dirty forest on the
edge of the stream. I never liked to camp out of sight
of the canoe in case anything happened during the
night&mdash;an attack, a flood, a forest fire, or anybody
trying to steal or get away with the canoe; the danger
from my own men being quite as great as from any
enemy I could have found. I well knew that if we
lost that canoe we were done for entirely.</p>

<p>There was a great falling off in the distance covered
that day owing to the laziness of my men. We had
only gone 67 kil. 600 m.&mdash;or 22 kil. 250 m. less than
the previous day, when we had travelled less hours
and gone easily over a distance of 89 kil. 850 m.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night of July 10th was cool&mdash;minimum temperature
58&deg; F. When we departed at 7.10 in the morning the
river was extremely tortuous at first&mdash;in one place
actually veering from north to due south. On the right
side of us was a lake divided by a low bank, 3 to 5 ft.
high, from the river by which it was fed. The entrance
into the lake was narrow. We had hardly gone
1 kil. when we found ourselves in a great basin 300 m.
long, 200 m. wide, with one large island&mdash;Nellie Island&mdash;150 m.
in length, and several other small islets in
its centre.</p>

<p>Another lagoon was shortly after reached on the
right bank, its inlet being 10 m. wide.</p>

<p>The waters of the Arinos were, at this point, of a
leaden placidity. We seemed to travel slowly now
that the current did not help us. The river was again
compressed into a deep channel 50 m. wide. Before us
loomed a cliff 100 ft. high, reflected with irreproachable
faithfulness in the almost still waters of the
stream. There was not a breath of wind to disturb
the mirror-like surface, nor to cool our sweating brows
in the stifling heat of the broiling sun. The lower 40<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-52" id="Pg_2-52"></a>[<a href="./images/2-52.png">52</a>]</span>
to 60 ft. of the cliff was red, the upper light yellow&mdash;almost
white. Where we reached this rocky wall there
was a circle 150 m. in diameter, with a low, thickly-wooded
triangular island, 80 m. long, 100 m. wide&mdash;Eleonora
Island.</p>

<p>The north-eastern passage was shallow, with a stony
bottom. We followed the northern channel along the
vertical wall. On leaving the island we came to a
stretch 2,500 m. long of beautiful water flowing due
north, with ideally fascinating banks embellished by
dense vegetation&mdash;neat, clean, and healthy&mdash;of the
richest green.</p>

<p>After crossing a bay, 100 m. wide, with volcanic
rocks showing through on both banks and in the river
bed, the stream was squeezed through a rocky neck
25 m. wide, and spread again immediately afterwards
to its normal width of 50 m. We were beginning to
find big rocks more frequently, many in the river channel&mdash;a
bad sign for us, for I feared we might soon encounter
rapids.</p>

<p>Wonderful <i>oleo pardo</i> trees (<i>Myrocarpus frondosus</i>
Fr. All.), with their octopus-like branches hanging
down to the water, were fairly common in that region.
There were two kinds of <i>oleo</i> trees in Brazil&mdash;the brown
or <i>oleo pardo</i> and the red or <i>oleo vermelho</i>, the latter
technically known as <i>Myrospermum erytroxylon</i> Fr.
All.</p>

<p>We subsequently entered a basin 150 m. wide which
contained a circular island 100 m. in diameter&mdash;Horus
Island.</p>

<p>Eight hundred metres farther we came to another
large circular bay with a large globular mass of lava on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-53" id="Pg_2-53"></a>[<a href="./images/2-53.png">53</a>]</span>
its left side. The current was very swift over a nasty
rocky bottom. The canoe was suddenly flung by the
current between an accumulation of rocks and an
island, and, as we found it impossible to turn, floated
down at an uncomfortable speed through a narrow
channel, dodging as best we could the many ugly
rocks just below the surface of the water. At the end
of this channel we encountered violent eddies forming
wide circles of most treacherous water&mdash;although on
the surface it looked placid enough.</p>

<p>The tributary Sumidoro, 30 m. wide at its mouth,
entered the Arinos from the west-south-west at this
point. Its water was deliciously clear. A little way off
to the left we could hear the noise of a waterfall on the
Sumidoro, before it joined the Arinos.</p>

<p>The river, after the meeting of this important
tributary, became even more exquisitely beautiful than
before. Rocks strewn about added to the picturesqueness
of the landscape as well as to the dangers of
navigation, while springs of crystalline water, cool and
quite delicious to drink, descended here and there from
the banks.</p>

<p>The river had an average width of 60 m. in this
part, and was much strewn with broken-up volcanic
boulders, especially on the left bank. On the right
bank was a beach of immaculate white sand. For
300 m. we went over a great stony place with shallow
water. We had to be careful, but all the same many
times did we bump with great force and get stuck
upon submerged rocks&mdash;which we could not see owing
to the blinding, glittering refraction of the sun upon
the troubled waters.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-54" id="Pg_2-54"></a>[<a href="./images/2-54.png">54</a>]</span>
A tributary 4 m. wide, coming from the north-east,
entered the Arinos on the right bank. A great number
of rubber trees were to be seen on the right bank,
where the forest was luxuriant; but not on the left
bank, where the growth of trees was scanty. <i>Carand&aacute;</i>
or <i>burity</i> or <i>tucuman</i> palms were plentiful along the
water's edge near the spot where a small rivulet entered
the Arinos on the left bank. Two thousand metres
farther down we came upon denuded country, low,
and liable to inundation when the river rose. Farther
on were campos and open country, with the exception
of a thin row of trees immediately along the river.
On the left we had luxuriant forest, wonderfully
healthy, neat and clean. The stream was there beautiful&mdash;60
to 70 m. wide.</p>

<p>When we had gone 10 kils. 800 m. more the entire
channel became strewn with rocks and mounds only
1 ft. below the surface of the water, and not unlike
parallel small dunes of sand with a deposit of gravel
upon them. For 700 m. the river was obstructed and
navigation rendered somewhat troublesome.</p>

<p>Where the river turned from bearings magnetic
310&deg; to 360&deg; (due N.) we went over a nasty stony place
with a strong <i>corrideira</i> above it, and we were confronted
with a rocky barrier almost the entire width
across the stream. We kept on the west side, the
only way where it was possible to get the canoe through.
A little farther another <i>corrideira</i>, stronger than the
first, obliged us to find a passage on the east side of
the river&mdash;which bore upon its bank <i>campos</i> and
<i>chapada</i>. Curious mounds of white sand and gravel
were visible in the centre of the river, and also near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-55" id="Pg_2-55"></a>[<a href="./images/2-55.png">55</a>]</span>
the left bank below the second <i>corrideira</i>; then we
came to parallel ridges of white sand and gravel right
across the river bottom at an angle of 45&deg; in relation
to the general direction of the stream.</p>

<p>Two tributaries, one 3 m. wide on the left bank, the
other 4 m. wide on the right side (the latter coming
from the north-east), swelled the Arinos from that
point. The width of the stream was now increased to
80 m., the water being shallow. The bed of the river
was ever changing, and supplied me with constant
interest. It was adorned with strangely precise triangles
of beautiful white sand exposed through a layer
of gravel which covered most of the river bottom.</p>

<p>A thickly-wooded hill range, 150 ft. high and extending
from W.S.W. to E.N.E., stood to the north
of us. Its slopes, eroded by the water, had caused a
landslip, leaving bare vertical red rock for half the
height of the hill-range and two much eroded spurs
of bright yellow and white earth extending into the
stream.</p>

<p>The river at that point turned from north to east.
Open country was again on our right after leaving the
hill range, and lowlands liable to inundation. Soon
afterwards, however, higher land appeared with banks
35 ft. high.</p>

<p>Swarms of small white butterflies played upon the
banks on the edge of the water.</p>

<p>Sand and gravel mounds were numerous in the
centre of the channel, with occasional basins of shallow
water with <i>corrideiras</i> upon them. For instance, in
one of those places for 150 m. the river was only from
1 to 3 ft. deep, and we had to drag the long heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-56" id="Pg_2-56"></a>[<a href="./images/2-56.png">56</a>]</span>
canoe, which drew 2 ft. of water, along the undulating
gravel bed. In fact, we spent a good deal
of our time every day in the water, pushing or pulling
along the canoe over innumerable obstacles, her great
length making it difficult to navigate her properly
through the many shallow and tortuous passages.</p>

<p>In a circular basin, 120 m. in diameter, beyond
that point we encountered strong eddies near the left
bank. On the north side big rocks emerged from the
water and a <i>corrideira</i> was formed.</p>

<p>An island 50 m. long and two other islets were
separated from the mainland by two channels, one
20 m. wide and only 3 in. deep&mdash;the other 60 m. wide
and 3 ft. deep. The right bank was there 45 ft. high.</p>

<p>Fifteen hundred metres farther down we entered
another basin 200 m. in diameter, with an island 80 m.
long and eight dry beaches of gravel.</p>

<p>My men were greatly excited in trying to capture
a <i>capivara</i> they had wounded. We actually got the
animal on board, but my men were so timid in going
near it that it jumped overboard again and made its
escape.</p>

<p>The right bank, which had been high, was now
reduced to only 4 ft. above the water; whereas the
left bank rose to a height of 46 ft. A rivulet 3 m. wide
coming from the west had cut its way through the
latter bank.</p>

<p>The main river was getting more and more magnificent
at every turn. I should have enjoyed the
journey very much had it not been for the constant
attention I had to pay to my men, who left their
paddles and steering gear at every moment in order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-57" id="Pg_2-57"></a>[<a href="./images/2-57.png">57</a>]</span>
fire recklessly at birds or <i>ariranhas</i> or <i>capivaras</i>, much
to the danger of everybody on board. They would
blaze away with their repeating rifles&mdash;and bullet cartridges,
of course&mdash;at parrots and even <i>colibri</i> birds
100 or 200 metres off. They said the rifles were bad
because they could never hit anything! I had ceased
scolding them. They made me positively ill with pity,
I was only praying for our supply of cartridges to come
to an end soon, so that if we were to die at all it might
not be through being pierced by one of our own
bullets.</p>

<p>The river had been flowing, with slight deviations,
northwards.</p>

<p>We came to an enchanting island 70 m. wide, with
thick vegetation upon it and fine rocks.</p>

<p>The river in that portion flowed practically north
in great stretches of 6,000 and 4,000 m. Another large
and beautiful island, 250 m. long and 70 wide&mdash;Ghislaine
Island&mdash;was passed, and we admired the gorgeous
vegetation upon it.</p>

<p>Below the island the river was 100 m. wide and
very shallow&mdash;not more than from 1 to 4 ft. in depth.
We halted at sunset, having gone that day 92 kil.
300 m.</p>

<p>During the night of July 11th my men suffered a
great deal from cold, the thermometer being as low as
45&deg; Fahrenheit. In the morning there was a thick fog
over the river&mdash;so thick that we had to delay our departure
until eight o'clock, as we could not see more
than two or three metres ahead.</p>

<p>Two kilometres beyond we came to a rivulet, 2 m.
wide, on the left bank, and soon after to a small <i>corri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-58" id="Pg_2-58"></a>[<a href="./images/2-58.png">58</a>]</span>deira</i>
with a navigable channel in the centre. Three
hundred metres farther down we passed another
tributary on the right bank. There was open country
with sparse stunted trees on the left of us, thick forest
with plenty of rubber trees on the right. I noticed
several good specimens of the <i>pao dolce</i>&mdash;a tree with
a curious cluster of yellow flowers not unlike the
flower of wistaria upside down. Not only was the <i>pao
dolce</i> pretty to look at, but a most refreshing beverage
could be made from a decoction of its leaves.</p>

<p>The course of the river was winding, with basins
and rapids of no great importance. Another tributary
2 m. wide was reached on the left bank, and soon after
another tiny streamlet entered the Arinos from the
same side.</p>

<p>I had a narrow escape. One of the men, who was
sitting behind me in the canoe, saw an <i>ariranha</i> (<i>Lutra
Brasiliensis</i>) put its head out of the water only ten
metres in front of the canoe. In his great hurry to kill
the beautiful animal he seized his rifle and emptied the
eight shots out of his magazine, firing the first three
shots close to my head on the left side, the other five
just as close on the other side. The muzzle of his
rifle was so near my ear that the noise deafened me for
several minutes and my hair was almost singed off.
The <i>ariranha</i>, needless to say, escaped unhurt, and
luckily so did I.</p>

<p>We went over a long strip of shallow water from
1 to 3 ft. deep. We now had open country on the
right bank, with a small streamlet finding its way into
the Arinos on that side. The river was flowing again
in long straight stretches&mdash;3,000 m., 2,000 m., 2,500 m.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-59" id="Pg_2-59"></a>[<a href="./images/2-59.png">59</a>]</span>
in length. In the portions where the banks were
thickly wooded innumerable rubber trees were to be
seen.</p>

<p>In the centre of a basin 150 m. wide we found another
island, 100 m. long and 50 m. wide, absolutely
smothered in vegetation and with a handsome gravel
spit at its southern end. Two kilometres farther another
basin, 300 m. broad, appeared. An amazing
quantity of rubber trees was to be seen round that
basin. Near the water we also found fine specimens
of the <i>mate</i> (<i>Ilex Paraguayensis</i> St. Hil.), with its wax-like
leaves, much used in certain parts of South
America for making a kind of tea.</p>

<p>For close upon 13 kils. the river flowed&mdash;with
slight deviations&mdash;almost always due north, and with
its limpid waters was of extraordinary beauty. The
country was open on the right side of us. We saw that
day two white <i>urub&uacute;</i> (<i>Cathartes</i>). The Brazilians have
a curious superstition about them. They say that if
you write with a quill taken from the wing of one of
these birds any business which you may be transacting
will go well; in fact, anything you may wish to do
and which you set down on paper with one of these
quills and ink is sure to turn out successfully.</p>

<p>That day I again suffered much, while taking
astronomical observations, from the millions of bees
and other insects which settled in swarms upon my
hands and face and stung me all over. We were then
in lat. 12&deg; 26&#8242;&middot;5 S., long. 56&deg; 37&#8242; W. The temperature
in the sun was not unbearable&mdash;merely 85&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, after we had enjoyed an excellent
lunch of fish, tinned provisions, and rice&mdash;my men also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-60" id="Pg_2-60"></a>[<a href="./images/2-60.png">60</a>]</span>
enjoying their <i>feijao</i> (boiled beans)&mdash;we continued our
journey. The river for 9,000 m. displayed first clean
<i>campos</i> and <i>chapada</i> on the left bank and dense forest
on the right, then <i>campos</i> on the right bank and a belt
of forest along the river on the left.</p>

<p>The <i>campos</i> were particularly neat in that region&mdash;merely
a few <i>burity</i> and <i>tucum</i> palms flourishing on the
edge of the water. In other localities a thick growth
of beautiful bamboos interspersed with gigantic palms
lined the banks.</p>

<p>Where the river turned due east we came to fairly
strong rapids. The water was shallow with mounds
of gravel, and we bumped about a great deal. Eventually
we all had to get into the water and push the
canoe along for greater comfort.</p>

<p>The river next formed a huge basin, 900 m. long
and 200 m. wide. A small tributary flowed into the
Arinos in the crescent-shaped bank on the right. That
bank had a height of 80 ft. On its summit quantities
of <i>Siphonia elastica</i> were to be admired. Farther
down it was on the left side that the river had high
banks, some 60 ft. high.</p>

<p>We went over a charming little <i>corrideira</i>. Strong
eddies were encountered on emerging from the rapids.
Where the right bank became lower&mdash;only 40 ft.&mdash;<i>chapada</i>
replaced the forest. The left bank was but
1 ft. above the level of the river, and the low country
beyond (south) was naturally liable to inundation.
For 4,000 m. the left bank was never higher than 4 ft.
The right bank also suddenly became very low in
that region.</p>

<p>Where the river turned from 290&deg; b.m. to 320&deg;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-61" id="Pg_2-61"></a>[<a href="./images/2-61.png">61</a>]</span>
b.m., there was a basin 700 m. broad with low banks.
An island&mdash;Lydia Island&mdash;200 m. in circumference,
rose within this basin on the north side and was
luxuriantly wooded.</p>

<p>We found that day beautiful beaches of gravel,
mostly on the right side. Then strong rapids and
<i>corrideiras</i>; below these more clean-looking gravel
beaches&mdash;this time on the left&mdash;were visible, and an
extensive island of gravel close to the right bank.</p>

<p>For 8,000 m. the gorgeous stream flowed almost in
a direct line northward, with dense forest and a wealthy
growth of rubber trees on both sides. Wonderful
<i>figueira</i> trees with their spotless white branches embellished
the landscape.</p>

<p>On the left a tributary of some size entered the
Arinos from the south-east in two arms with an island
between; the largest arm was 40 m. wide, the smaller
10 m. Then another stream entered the Arinos on the
right side.</p>

<p>We were again confronted by a large basin enclosed
on the north by a crescent-shaped wall 100 ft.
high, at the foot of which at the level of the river was
a quantity of d&eacute;bris of yellow rock. The river at
that spot turned sharply from 20&deg; b.m. (N.N.E.) to
290&deg; b.m.&mdash;that is to say, almost north-west. The
width of the Arinos at this point was from 80 to 100 m.</p>

<p>Towards sunset we came to a beautiful island
200 m. long. We cleared a sufficiently large space in
the dense and gorgeous vegetation to make our camp
for the night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had another cool night on July 12th&mdash;minimum
temperature 47&deg; F. It was very damp, and in the
morning we had, as on the previous day, a thick mist
which prevented our starting until it cleared up, at
7.40 a.m. The mist rose in columns and square blocks
over the warmish water of the river. The right bank
of the Arinos was 40 ft. high.</p>

<p>We had gone some 1,500 m. from our camp when
we came to a magnificent island, 400 m. long and 200 m.
wide&mdash;Griselda Island&mdash;which divided the stream into
two channels.</p>

<p>All the islands we had seen of late showed on the
up-stream side a more or less extensive spit of beautifully
coloured gravel and glittering crystals. The
latter shone in the sun with such iridescent luminosity
that it gave those islands a fairy-like appearance.</p>

<p>We encountered troublesome eddies which swung
the canoe about, and in one case actually spun her
completely round in a most alarming manner, tearing
out of Alcides' hands the steering gear, which we had
some trouble in recovering.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-63" id="Pg_2-63"></a>[<a href="./images/2-63.png">63</a>]</span>
There were many handsome large-leafed <i>pacov&aacute;</i>,
somewhat resembling banana palms; also quantities
of <i>Siphonia elastica</i>, although these were not quite so
plentiful as farther south nor the trees so high. A
tiny brook of delicious water descended into the Arinos
from the left bank.</p>

<p>Ten thousand five hundred metres farther down
from Griselda Island we came to another island, 300 m.
long and 50 m. broad&mdash;Negrino Island&mdash;with the usual
spit of gravel and beautiful crystals on the south side.
This island was 10 ft. high above the water, with some
trees on it, but not such luxuriant vegetation as on
most of the other islands we had seen.</p>

<p>A stream 5 m. wide at the mouth, coming from the
N.N.W., entered the Arinos on the right side. The
main river had a direction of 305&deg; b.m.&mdash;that is to say,
virtually north-west. Great volcanic slabs of rock and
sand-banks were now reached.</p>

<p>The sun was not extraordinarily hot&mdash;90&deg; F. at noon.
The country on either side was open&mdash;chiefly <i>chapada</i>.
Beautiful gravel beaches were now seen, extending
half-way across the river, particularly from the left side.</p>

<p>Another tributary 5 m. wide coming from the N.N.E.
was passed on our right, and beyond this a thick forest
with rubber trees was visible, while <i>chapada</i> continued
on the left.</p>

<p>Round a big basin 200 m. in diameter, containing
shallow water from 1 to 6 ft. deep, stood a mass of
gigantic trees with verdant healthy foliage, and innumerable
abnormally tall <i>burity</i> palms, over 100 ft. high,
and <i>tucum</i> (<i>Astrocaryum tucuma</i>)&mdash;also of immense size.</p>

<p>Many huge <i>trinch&atilde;o</i> fish followed our canoe for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-64" id="Pg_2-64"></a>[<a href="./images/2-64.png">64</a>]</span>
time, gazing curiously at us. They came so impudently
near that my men actually hit them on the head with
their paddles.</p>

<p>One more streamlet entered the Arinos on the right
side just before we reached a big basin, 250 m. in
diameter, with wonderful gravel beaches in regular
little mounds stretching half-way across the basin.
Another little tributary (on the right side) came next,
7,000 m. farther down stream. The vegetation was
there so dense and so entangled that we could find nowhere
a suitable spot on which to land for our midday
halt. About noon, however, <i>chapada</i> and open country
again appeared on the right bank for a distance of
some 2,000 m.</p>

<p class="fsc">Going down a Violent Rapid in a Narrow Channel.</p>
<hr />
<p>There we indulged in a plentiful lunch, the country
round being as still as death. Not a sign could be
seen anywhere of a human being; not a column of
smoke indicating the presence of man rose anywhere
in the clear sky. Nowhere did we meet disturbed
vegetation; nowhere did we notice a trail or a passage
through the vegetation coming to the water; nowhere
did we meet abandoned camps or any signs whatever
that human beings had ever lived there. There was
no animal life of fair size on the surface; no parrots, no
monkeys, no mammals of any kind&mdash;only millions of
insects, which made one's life a burden.</p>

<p>It was not so with the river, which was swarming
with innocent fish, only too ready to be killed and
supply us with excellent meals. The reason, of course,
that the river was so full of fish, and that the fish displayed
such delightful simplicity, was because there
were there no human beings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-65" id="Pg_2-65"></a>[<a href="./images/2-65.png">65</a>]</span>
Soon after leaving camp&mdash;all the happier for an
excellent lunch&mdash;we came once more to thick, beautiful,
clean forest on both sides. Again rubber was plentiful,
and absolutely untouched by the collector's hand. The
river was getting amazingly beautiful, 200 m. wide
all along, the water like a faultless silver mirror irreproachably
reflecting each leaf, each branch of the
motionless trees on both banks. There was not a
breath of wind to disturb the tranquillity of that
deliciously restful scene.</p>

<p>Yet one more gorgeous island&mdash;Alastor Island&mdash;300
m. long and 80 to 100 m. wide, was seen. It was
preceded on the south-east side by innumerable gravel
mounds just emerging above the water surface, then
by a magnificent gravel beach with numberless beautiful
crystals. On the left bank a tributary 15 m. wide
entered the Arinos from the south-west.</p>

<p>The river was getting more and more entrancing
at every turn. Profuse blossoms of the most gorgeous
yellow shone resplendent in all their beauty against the
background of dark green foliage. The entire edge of
the forest was festooned with daintily-leafed creepers
and with myriads of convolvuli of the purest amethyst
colour.</p>

<p>There was poetry in the scene&mdash;frequently disturbed,
perhaps, by the inconceivable oaths of the
man to whom was entrusted the heavy task of baling
out the water from the canoe, which leaked badly.
She was fissured from end to end, and we had no
effective means of preventing the water coming in; in
fact, if the baling were not done quickly and continuously
with a bucket, the water soon gained and reached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-66" id="Pg_2-66"></a>[<a href="./images/2-66.png">66</a>]</span>
the platform on which we had placed the baggage.
Our feet, of course, were in water all day long. We
did not mind that so much. In fact, our feet got so
soaked with moisture that we could peel off the skin in
big patches with the greatest ease.</p>

<p>After travelling across a basin 250 m. broad, we
came to a <i>corrideira</i> with shallow water. We dashed
with great speed sideways over a bank of gravel, and
nearly turned turtle. The gravel was banked up
against the lee side of the canoe, and with a strong
current pushing her we had the greatest trouble to pull
her off again.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of rubber, particularly on
the left bank, while on the right, <i>chapada</i> was again
observed. The river was so wonderfully tidy that, had
it not been for its great breadth, one would have felt
as if going through a watercourse in England.</p>

<p>From the east came a little tributary, 2 m. wide, on
the right bank. Another beautiful island, 500 m. long
and 80 m. wide&mdash;Helena Island&mdash;a most enchanting
place, preceded by the usual gravel mounds and beach,
was passed in the afternoon. Small streamlets entered
the main stream, one on each side&mdash;one 6 kils. beyond
Helena Island, the other one a little farther.</p>

<p>The river maintained its average width of 200 m.
nearly all the time. Late in the afternoon we passed
on the left bank a hill 120 ft. high, belonging to a
range that extended from E.S.E. to W.N.W. at an
angle to the river, which there flowed in a direction
almost north. There was plenty of rubber of excellent
quality near the water.</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving this range we came to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-67" id="Pg_2-67"></a>[<a href="./images/2-67.png">67</a>]</span>
lagoon, then to open campos behind a thin row of
stunted trees on the left bank. The lagoon was situated
at a point where the river described a curve from north
to 70&deg; b.m. Two small streamlets entered the Arinos
on the right. We made camp near a small lagoon in
the forest shortly after sunset.</p>

<p>The distance we had travelled during the last
two days was 86 kil. 900 m. on July 11th, and 76 kil.
600 m. on July 12th, or altogether 163 kil. 500 m.</p>

<p>To anybody accustomed to travelling in equatorial
countries it seems amazing, on returning to civilization,
to find what curious notions people have of the tropical
forest. Even in the case of writers of distinction I
could quote many passages which are painfully ridiculous.
One of the greatest modern Italian writers,
for instance&mdash;who, by the way, in one of his latest
novels, copied almost word for word many pages from
my books&mdash;added the poetic touch that in the tropical
forest flowers were found so large that they could not
be picked, and fruit so enormous that no human tooth
could bite it! Again, the majority of people believe
that it is impossible to go through the forest without
cutting your way all the time&mdash;the "cutting a way
through" meaning to most people the constant chopping
down of trees of all sizes, undergrowth, bamboos,
<i>liane</i>, and other creepers. As a matter of fact, any
experienced traveller has much less trouble in going
through the forest than people imagine. This is not
the case with people unacquainted with the forest, or
with people whose sense of observation is not much
developed. One can go sometimes for miles through
the dense forest without once using knives at all;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-68" id="Pg_2-68"></a>[<a href="./images/2-68.png">68</a>]</span>
although necessarily a knife must be carried, as there
are places where a cut from its blade will make passing
through more comfortable. This is particularly true
of the Brazilian forest. The forests of that country,
especially in the central region where I was then travelling,
were wonderfully clean, when once you entered
them, although, when seen from the river, they appeared
impenetrable. Near the water, owing to the
moisture, there was frequently a thick but narrow
belt&mdash;only a few metres wide&mdash;of dense growth. Beyond
it, when you were in the forest itself, nothing
grew under the trees, and the ground was just as clean
as the best kept English park. One could walk in
comfort without the slightest trouble, an occasional
well-applied blow with the heavy-bladed knife disentangling
in a second an interfering <i>liana</i> which might
stand in one's way.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that you can get under
or over <i>liane</i>, or shift them on one side, without ever
having the trouble of severing them. It is only occasionally,
when they are entangled, that it saves time
to cut them. Barring an occasional thick belt along
the Amazon River, it is almost safe to assert that an
experienced man can travel, alone, anywhere in the
forests of Brazil without carrying a penknife. This is
not the case, of course, when you are travelling with a
caravan and with baggage, when a sufficiently large
passage has to be opened.</p>

<p>In Africa the equatorial forests are incomparably
more difficult to traverse than the Brazilian forests,
and those who assert the Brazilian forests to be impenetrable
only say so because they do not know what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-69" id="Pg_2-69"></a>[<a href="./images/2-69.png">69</a>]</span>
they are talking about. Even when it comes to
actually chopping down trees in the Brazilian forests,
one blow with the axe or with the knife will easily cut
down a fair-sized tree. As I have already stated elsewhere,
most of the Brazilian forest trees have no resistance
whatever. They are full of water, and, with a
judicious blow, can be cut almost as easily as celery.
Many are the trees also, the inside of which near the
ground has been eaten up entirely by ants, and it
was not uncommon when you leant heavily against a
tree that you and the tree tumbled down. Ants do
not seem to attack lactiferous trees, such as those
producing rubber, which therefore flourished in that
particular region.</p>

<p>Most of the trees in that particular part of the
forest were small in diameter, and only had branches
or leaves at a very great height. That was why the
forests in Brazil looked so extraordinarily clean beneath,
in contrast to the equatorial forest in such
countries as Central Africa or the Philippine Islands.
The wonderful cleanliness of the river, to which I have
so often alluded, was a great contrast to the masses of
floating decomposing vegetation which is always to
be seen in the African rivers.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature during the night of
July 13th was 51&deg; Fahr. During that night we were
suddenly roused by our dogs barking furiously. We
heard strange noises, as if people were trying to run
away quickly through the forest. Indians had, much
to our surprise, come quite close to our camp, and had
it not been for the alarm given by the dogs we should
most likely have been attacked by them. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-70" id="Pg_2-70"></a>[<a href="./images/2-70.png">70</a>]</span>
morning we heard in the distance their war-cries and
piercing ululations, which rent the air. Judging merely
by the noise they made, there must have been from
thirty to fifty of them. My men were greatly excited
over this experience. These Indians belonged, I think,
to the Tapanhonas tribe.</p>

<p>We left our camp at 7.45 in the morning. As the
river was there in an almost straight line for 8 kil.,
we continued hearing&mdash;more and more faintly, of
course, as we went on&mdash;for some distance the excited
yells of the Indians.</p>

<p>The left bank, through which a streamlet cut its way
into the Arinos, was fairly open with <i>chapada</i>. An island,
150 m. wide and 200 m. long&mdash;Julia Island&mdash;was next
seen. It had an extensive beach of gravel at its
southern end, and the island itself was covered with
dense and very beautiful vegetation. Another streamlet
1 m. wide entered the Arinos opposite the island
from the left side. Farther on another streamlet, 3 m.
wide at the mouth, and coming from the north, flowed
into the main stream on the right side. Three and a
half kilometres farther another tributary streamlet,
also 3 m. wide, was met on the right. We there saw
<i>chapada</i> on both banks as we went along, with merely
a thin edge of trees along the river.</p>

<p>Where the river described a graceful elbow, a
charming tongue of land, with deliciously green grass
upon it, was most refreshing to the eyes. A river 8 m.
wide at the mouth was met a little way beyond on the
left side. We noticed opposite that place a beautiful
spot for making a camp, but it was not a convenient
hour for us, and so we went along.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-71" id="Pg_2-71"></a>[<a href="./images/2-71.png">71</a>]</span>
About 1,500 m. farther down a long narrow island
(200 m. long, 80 m. wide)&mdash;Gemma Island&mdash;heavily
wooded, was passed and admired. It had the usual
gravel spit on its southern or up-stream point, the
river in that particular spot flowing due north in a
perfectly straight line for 4,000 m. The island stood in
the centre of a basin 200 m. broad. There were <i>campos</i>
and <i>chapada</i> on the left bank.</p>

<p>We landed on the island, and found most beautifully
clean forest, nice and cool in the greenish dim light
which penetrated through the dense masses of foliage.
Particularly noticeable for their beauty were the handsome
large mimosas.</p>

<p>On the right bank of the river was forest with
plenty of rubber trees, but occasionally even on that
side patches of what the Brazilians call <i>serrad&atilde;o</i> (close
forest) were met with.</p>

<p>A hill range 120 ft. high formed a crescent from
west to north-west on the left side of the stream. A
kilometre and a half farther forest was to be seen on
the left side of the river; whereas on the right was
<i>chapada</i> and <i>campos</i>, quite open. A picturesque rocky
island, 15 m. in diameter, in laminated horizontal and
rich brown volcanic rock, rose 3 ft. above the water in
the centre of the stream. From that spot for 2 kil.
I noticed <i>chapada</i> on the right bank; then after that
was beautiful dense forest on both sides, with innumerable
vigorous rubber trees.</p>

<p>The river there was 200 m. wide and had shallow
water with strong <i>corrideiras</i> over enormous parallel
transverse dunes of sand and gravel which formed the
bottom. Islets of gravel were exposed, especially near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-72" id="Pg_2-72"></a>[<a href="./images/2-72.png">72</a>]</span>
the left bank and in the centre, leaving only a more or
less navigable channel near the right bank.</p>

<p>We ran aground many a time along the 500 m. of
shallow water, varying from 6 in. to 3 ft. deep. We
emerged into a large basin 300 m. wide where eddies
of no great strength were formed. On the edge of
the beautiful basin we halted for our lunch, and to
take the usual astronomical observations at local noon.
We were in lat. 12&deg; 26&#8242;&middot;5 S.; long. 56&deg; 47&#8242; W.</p>

<p>I do not know if I have ever seen such swarms of
bees and butterflies as I saw at that place. They
seemed to swoop down upon us in myriads from all
sides. Taking the solar observations with the sextant
and artificial horizon, I endured positive torture with
the hundreds of bees which settled on my forehead,
nose and hands; while thousands of mosquitoes and
ants stung my legs, arms and face in those spots where
it was not possible to wrap myself up with towels.</p>

<p>It will be noticed in most of the photographs which
were taken along the river, and some of which illustrate
this book, that all my men have their heads wrapped
up. This was done as a protection against the
tantalizing insects. The temperature was warm; that
day, for instance, was 105&deg; F. in the sun and 86&deg; in
the shade.</p>

<p>We left again at 1.15, my men being&mdash;for a change&mdash;in
a good mood, owing to the amusing time we
always had fishing. We had been making excellent
progress during the last two or three days. The strange
man X enlivened our journey with diabolical songs
and with crude wit, which sent his companions into
fits of laughter. When they were in a merry mood or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-73" id="Pg_2-73"></a>[<a href="./images/2-73.png">73</a>]</span>
excited, I noticed that they paddled along much
quicker and better, so I did not try to put a check to
the abominable language which would have jarred the
feelings of any one not born and bred in the interior of
Brazil.</p>

<p>It was quite interesting to me to find in that region
so much <i>chapada</i> and open country, as I had fully expected
to find thick forest all along. What struck me
particularly on the Arinos, and which I could not very
well explain, was that nearly invariably, when you
had thick forest on one side of the stream, you had
open country on the other, and only seldom noticed
either forest or campos on both sides of the stream at
the same time.</p>

<p>After passing <i>chapada</i> on the left bank we came to
a great many rocks just above water. A river 3 m.
wide entered the Arinos on the right side, and there
was to be seen an immense quantity of beautiful rubber
trees&mdash;as yet untouched by human being. The river
kept its width of 200 m. After going along <i>chapada</i>
on the left bank for some 3 kil., we came to magnificent
forest&mdash;this time on both sides&mdash;with a luxuriant
growth of rubber trees.</p>

<p>The scene, in its wonderful quietude, was most
impressive. It made one's heart bleed to think that
such rich land should lie unknown and unexploited in
these enlightened and enterprising days of the twentieth
century.</p>

<p>The sky above us was always interesting, with its
typical filaments of mist, their lengthy radiations faintly
marked upon the vivid blue of the sky vault and
making a centre in the north. These radiations were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-74" id="Pg_2-74"></a>[<a href="./images/2-74.png">74</a>]</span>
in appearance not unlike giant ostrich feathers. They
were formed, I think, over the great streams which
flowed northwards into the Amazon.</p>

<p>We were troubled that day with numerous eddies
and shallow water, owing to the great width of the
river. Innumerable mounds of gravel rose in the centre
of the stream up to a few inches below the water level.</p>

<p>Another hill range, 100 ft. high, met that day was
crescent-shaped, the arc of a circle thus described being
from south-east by east to north-east.</p>

<p>The hill range on the north-east side of us was
eroded, exposing a red vertical wall 60 ft. high. A
small river 2 m. wide coming from the east entered the
Arinos on the right bank.</p>

<p>For 3,500 m. from that point the stream had an
average width of 250 m., and was really magnificent
with the wonderful cleanliness of the water&mdash;not the
slightest impurity, not a speck of wood or a leaf floating
upon its surface.</p>

<p>Fourteen kilometres of heavenly navigation&mdash;barring
X's language and the comments of his companions&mdash;and
we came to an ideal triangular island, 1,200 m.
long, 200 m. wide at its broadest point, with the
usual extensive gravel spit at its southern end&mdash;Victor
Emmanuel Island. The vegetation upon it
was too gorgeous for words, but there was no animal
life except insects.</p>

<p>Four kilometres farther a basin 300 m. in diameter
and from 1 to 6 ft. deep was crossed, in which a strong
<i>corrideira</i> was met. The navigable channel was in the
centre of the basin. A stream 10 m. wide, of most
beautiful crystalline water, which had its origin from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-75" id="Pg_2-75"></a>[<a href="./images/2-75.png">75</a>]</span>
the south-west, threw itself into the Arinos on the left
side, some 2,000 m. below the basin.</p>

<p>From this point for 8 kil. the river flowed with a
slight deviation of 10&deg; in a northerly direction. The
left bank of the river was now quite open, with patches
of <i>chapada</i> and somewhat taller but still stunted vegetation
beyond; a thin row of tall trees lined the river
side. On the right bank was luxuriant forest, and
again plenty of beautiful rubber trees. Two islets of
gravel were next seen.</p>

<p>We were experiencing great difficulty in getting
suitable camping places at the right time when we
needed them. By 4.30, having come across a spot
which seemed suitable, we halted, having gone that
day 85 kil. 700 m.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were still at an elevation of 1,100 ft. The water
was almost stagnant, and was evidently being held
up by some obstacle. I feared that we should soon
encounter nasty rapids. Watching the sky, I was
generally able to foretell what was ahead of us in the
river. In fact, a pretty mackerel sky, particularly to
the north-west, showed me that the water of our river
must be breaking up considerably, either in rapids or
waterfalls, in order to produce sufficient moisture in
the air to cause the accumulation of those cloudlets.
I always noticed that wherever there were heavy rapids
farther down clouds of more or less magnitude formed
directly above them at a comparatively low elevation,
and remained there owing to the perfect stillness of
the air.</p>

<p>On the night of July 14th the cold was felt intensely
by my men, the thermometer actually showing a
minimum of 38&deg; F.</p>

<p>During the night my men had a great excitement.
A large pachyderm, an <i>anta</i> (<i>Tapirus Americanus</i>) inquisitively
came in the midst of our camp. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-77" id="Pg_2-77"></a>[<a href="./images/2-77.png">77</a>]</span>
evidently as much astonished at seeing us as we were
in discovering its presence. My men had been firing
their cartridges away during the day at rocks, at fish
in the river, and so on, so that when their rifles were
really needed the magazines were all empty, and gave
the <i>anta</i> plenty of time to hop away gracefully into the
darkness of the forest.</p>

<p>I had given orders to them to keep watch all night,
as a precaution against an attack from the Indians,
but my orders were, as usual, disobeyed. Personally,
I took the first watch every night, sitting up till 2 a.m.,
which time I occupied in writing up my notes, working
out computations of astronomical observations, classifying
the botanical and geological specimens collected
during the day, and replenishing my cameras with
new plates.</p>

<p>My men had eaten up all the supply of beans
(<i>feijao</i>) I had purchased at Diamantino, and therefore
even the cook could not be kept awake during the
night. The first rubber collector I had picked up when
coming down the Arinos was now our cook, and diabolical
indeed was his <i>cuisine</i>. Several times already
his life had been in danger from the angry attacks of
his companions, the quantities of pepper he sprinkled
on everything he cooked causing us all to cough sometimes
for half-hours at a time. He was very fond of
pepper himself, and could not understand why none
of us liked it.</p>

<p>During the night we still had a mackerel sky, covering
one-third of the sky vault, and a clear triangle of
mist, the apex of which was to the west, extending
towards the east, close upon the horizon line. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-78" id="Pg_2-78"></a>[<a href="./images/2-78.png">78</a>]</span>
we left in the morning at 7.30, we had <i>chapada</i> and
<i>campos</i> on the right bank and forest on the other side.
We had gone some 8&frac12; kil. from our camp when we
came to a hill range, 75 ft. high, on the right bank,
encircling the river with its thickly wooded slopes.
There was a tributary 25 m. wide, a most beautiful
stream, on the right bank. It came from 70&deg; b.m.
Its water was deliciously clear. Where it entered the
Arinos it had deposited a bank of crystals and
marble pebbles&mdash;yellow, red, and white&mdash;which in
the dazzling sun shone with great brilliancy at the
bottom of the river. Numberless rubber trees were to
be seen at that spot on the banks of the Arinos, and
also on those of this new important tributary.</p>

<p>Two kilometres farther, where the Arinos was 280 m.
wide, it looked just like a big lake of stagnant water.
The country was quite open on the left side, first
<i>chapada</i>, then <i>campos</i>.</p>

<p>By 9.30 a.m. we had a most wonderful display of
clouds and radiations of what looked like so many
mares' tales from the W.S.W. The river at that point
flowed for 1 kil. in a direction due south. We came
to a basin 300 m. across with a spit of white sand on
the north-west side. In this basin was an island&mdash;Nattal&igrave;
Island&mdash;200 m. long, 20 m. wide, 10 ft. above
water, with a fine beach of sand and gravel on the
south side. Gravel mounds were innumerable in the
centre of this stream.</p>

<p>After we had gone some 8 kil. farther down my
men shot an <i>ariranha</i>. They had a belief that these
<i>ariranhas</i> would easily kill a man in the water. As we
have already seen, they certainly had a great craving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-79" id="Pg_2-79"></a>[<a href="./images/2-79.png">79</a>]</span>
for blood and were always brave in attacking. My men
called them "water leopards." In fact, the head of
the <i>ariranha</i> was not unlike the head of a cat or a
leopard. Although shot through the body two or
three times, the <i>ariranha</i> actually came thrice to the
attack of the canoe&mdash;so that my men were able to
seize it by the tail and pull it inside the canoe while it
was in a dying condition.</p>

<p>Sixteen kilometres farther down we came to another
beautiful tributary with delightfully clear water,
6 m. wide where it met the Arinos. One hundred
metres lower down another little tributary, only 4 m.
wide, also on the right bank, joined our stream. The
first tributary seemed to come from the north-east.
At the mouth of this tributary was a spot which would
have made a lovely halting place, but as it was too early
in the day we reluctantly went on in a north-westerly
direction, first for 4 kil., then north-east for 5 kil., passing
through a large basin 300 m. wide, containing two
islets, then passing charming sand-beaches, and farther
on another tributary, 8 m. wide, on the left of us, also
with deliciously clear water. When we proceeded on our
journey after lunch we found big rocks more frequent
in the stream, and went over a field of great boulders
just under the surface of the water that stretched half-way
across the shallow river.</p>

<p>Eight kilometres from our halting-place we came to
an extensive stony place with a strong rapid. One kilometre
beyond, a small tributary flowed into the Arinos
from the left side. On the left side we had a red and
brilliant yellow bank 70 ft. high, part of a small range
of hills which turned the river from N.N.W. to N.N.E.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-80" id="Pg_2-80"></a>[<a href="./images/2-80.png">80</a>]</span>
Another small tributary 2 m. wide was seen on the left
side. Then, 4 kil. farther on, another tributary, also 2 m.
wide, and also on the left side, came from the south-west.
Three thousand six hundred metres beyond this,
we entered a basin 320 m. wide with an island 150 m.
long, including its gravel spit. Three more islands were
seen a little way beyond&mdash;Meraud, Tanis, and Loel
Islands, Meraud being the largest. Another island was
on the left of the river, leaving a passage 50 m. wide
on its west side. The group of islands was of alluvial
formation with deposits of gravel below.</p>

<p>The river in that region was too beautiful for words.
The foliage of the thick heavy forest on both sides was
densely green, the banks most tidy, and running in an
almost straight line for 10,000 m. During all that
distance the stream was 300 m. wide, and its speckless
water reflected with marvellous definition each leaf
and branch against the background of deep green.
Neat gravel banks occurred frequently in the shallow
water.</p>

<p>Some 300 m. down this long straight stretch of river
a tributary 8 m. wide, coming from 210&deg; b.m., threw
itself into the Arinos. Strong eddies were formed, as
many rocks were strewn in the centre of the stream.</p>

<p>One kilometre farther a conglomerate mass of
granite and yellow and red lava, with impurities embedded
in it, emerged just above the water in the centre
of the stream.</p>

<p>Another streamlet, 2 m. wide, and of wonderfully
limpid water, joined the Arinos on the right side. It
came from the north-east. Then another little streamlet
was seen on the left side.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-81" id="Pg_2-81"></a>[<a href="./images/2-81.png">81</a>]</span>
At the end of 10 kil., where the river made a wide
angle from 330&deg; b.m. to 350&deg; b.m., and another straight
line of 4,000 m. stretched in front of us, we beheld a
huge submerged bank of sharp volcanic conglomerate
rock. In fact, we unexpectedly almost ran into it. Had
we done so at the rate at which we were travelling, our
canoe would certainly have been smashed to pieces
against the sharp-edged fractured rock&mdash;just as sharp
at the angles as the blades of knives.</p>

<p>Where the river turned once more from 350&deg; b.m.
to 320&deg; b.m. another small tributary appeared on the
right bank, and there a lot of handsome <i>mate</i> trees
(<i>Ilex paraguayensis</i>) seemed to flourish, and were certainly
pretty to look at.</p>

<p>Farther down we again came to <i>chapada</i> on the
left bank and heavy foliaged forest with a certain
number of rubber trees on the right bank. The left
bank, where it described a great sweeping circle, was
low and sandy, some 12 ft. above the level of the
river. Only a thin fringe of low trees grew there on
the edge of the water.</p>

<p>Six kilometres from the last tributary on the right
bank another streamlet, 3 m. wide, coming from the
S.S.W., cut its way through the left bank. Two thousand
five hundred metres farther on another tributary
20 m. wide&mdash;a deliciously beautiful stream&mdash;flowed
gracefully into the Arinos on the right side from the
north-east.</p>

<p>We made our camp at the junction of the two
streams. The camp was extremely bad. It was
already late in the evening and we could find no other
suitable spot. We had gone that day 83 kils. I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-82" id="Pg_2-82"></a>[<a href="./images/2-82.png">82</a>]</span>
quite satisfied with the progress we had made during
the last few days. During the evening I made an
excursion on foot along the tributary river to the
north-east for several kilometres, but I found nothing of
particular interest.</p>

<p>During the night we received another visit from
an <i>anta</i>, but the pachyderm again escaped before my
men had time to kill it. We heard cries of Indians in
the distance. My men were in a great state of mind
for fear we should be attacked. I sat up the entire
night in order to be ready in case of emergency.</p>

<p>I took that opportunity of computing and checking
many of the astronomical observations I had taken,
and developing a great number of photographic glass
plates.</p>

<p>In my experience I have found that the fears
people have of spoiling negatives unless one is shut up
in an absolutely dark room are quite exaggerated.
On that particular occasion, for instance, and on many
previous and subsequent occasions, I developed the
glass plates&mdash;and I think with satisfactory results&mdash;out
in the open, with merely the fly-leaf of the tent
sheltering me overhead so as not to have the direct
rays of the stars shining upon the photographic plates.
Indeed, there was light enough coming in around the
tent for me to see quite plainly what was going on
outside. I simply covered up the developing trays as
an extra precaution, and seldom&mdash;in fact, never&mdash;spoiled
a negative in process of development.</p>

<p>I also found developing tanks quite serviceable
when a great number of negatives had to be developed
quickly. The red lamp necessary for photographic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-83" id="Pg_2-83"></a>[<a href="./images/2-83.png">83</a>]</span>
work was invariably a great nuisance. I do not believe
that a compact, practical dark-room lamp has yet been
invented which is really serviceable to an explorer.
If it is a candle lamp the candle melts quickly in
those hot countries, producing an extra large flame
which generally cracks the red glass, and makes so
much smoke that the upper aperture becomes blocked
and puts the light out when you happen to be at the
most crucial point of your work.</p>

<p>The oil lanterns would be better, were it not for
the difficulty and messy nuisance of carrying and re-filling
the lamp each time with oil. Electric lights,
which are the only practical ones, of course are out of
the question when you have to be away for a year or
a year and a half, the storage batteries getting damaged
easily by damp and the innumerable accidents which
you have when exploring.</p>

<p>The greatest care had to be used in repacking the
developed glass plates. I owe to the care I took
of them that I was able to bring back 800 excellent
negatives out of 800 glass plates exposed.</p>

<p>The night was a little warmer than usual on
July 15th&mdash;minimum 53&deg; F. There was a heavy mist
over the river when we rose in the morning, and we
had to delay our departure until 7.30 a.m. When the
mist began to rise it hung about in beautiful curves
converging to a common radiating centre to the west.</p>

<p>During the night I had noticed a weird lunar effect&mdash;a
perfect cross of immense proportions intersecting the
crescent moon, which had a radiating halo surrounding
it.</p>

<p>Four thousand metres from our camp we came to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-84" id="Pg_2-84"></a>[<a href="./images/2-84.png">84</a>]</span>
a tributary 3 m. wide on the left side of the river. It
came from the W.S.W. Near this a streamlet 1 m.
wide entered the Arinos on the right side, and another
streamlet of equal size farther down on the left bank.
There was fairly thin forest on both sides as we went
on, kilometre after kilometre, the water of the river
being almost stagnant in that part and heavy to paddle
along.</p>

<p>Five hundred metres down the straight stretch of
river, 4,000 m. long, we came to another charming
affluent, 10 m. wide, coming from the E.S.E. Farther
on, another tributary 2 m. wide entered the Arinos on
the left side, and formed a shallow bank of gravel extending
half-way across the stream.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Result of Half an Hour's Fishing on the Arinos-Juruena.</p>
<hr />
<p>As I have stated elsewhere, the mentality of
Brazilians was somewhat difficult to understand by
people of any other nation. They did everything the
wrong way, according to our notions. I had been
worried a great deal, the reader may remember, at the
most unpractical way in which my men loaded the
animals when I had my caravan of mules and horses.
I had been more than amazed at Brazilian ideas of
architecture, sculpture, painting and music. I had on
many occasions been dumbfounded at their ideas of
honour and truthfulness. Now once more I was sickly
amused&mdash;I had by then ceased to be amazed or dumbfounded
or angry&mdash;at the way my men daily packed
the baggage in the canoe. The baggage was naturally
taken out of the canoe every night when we made
our camp, for the canoe leaked so badly that
when we arrived anywhere and halted we had to
beach her, or else, where this was not possible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-85" id="Pg_2-85"></a>[<a href="./images/2-85.png">85</a>]</span>
we found her in the morning almost entirely submerged.
Naturally we invariably selected shallow
places where we could bale the water out and float her
again.</p>

<p>Returning to the baggage: the men every morning
insisted on loading the canoe in front, where the four
men were situated paddling, and the three dogs of
the expedition were also accommodated. I sat in the
centre of the canoe, and Alcides at the helm naturally
stood in the stern. The man whose incessant daily
occupation it was to bale out the water of course had
to be with the group of four men in the bow, since, the
canoe being so heavily weighted at that end, the water
found its way down there.</p>

<p>Now, loading the canoe in such a fashion, at the
bow, had the double drawback of causing a greater
resistance against the water, and therefore nearly
doubling the work of the men in paddling. Then again,
when we ran aground or struck a rock, the impact was
more severe on the canoe&mdash;not to speak of the difficulty
of getting her off again. The steering, too, was also
much more difficult with the stern of the canoe so far
out of the water.</p>

<p>I pointed out the mistake to my men, but it was no
use arguing, and they refused to follow my advice.
Like all ignorant people, they thought they knew
everything better than anybody else, and as, in a way,
they were the chief sufferers for their own conceit, I
thought I would avoid unpleasantness and let them
do things their own way as long as we kept going forward
on our journey.</p>

<p>Alcides, too, who by now had become imbued with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-86" id="Pg_2-86"></a>[<a href="./images/2-86.png">86</a>]</span>
the idea that he was as good a navigator as Christopher
Columbus or Vasco da Gama, had the strangest notions
of navigation. He never avoided grounding the canoe
on every bank he saw; he never avoided dashing the
canoe into every rock which stood or did not stand
in our way. I never could understand exactly why
he did that, except for the mischievous pleasure he
derived from giving the men who were sitting at the
other end of the canoe a violent bump, which often
rolled them over altogether.</p>

<p>When we left Goyaz my men insisted on purchasing
life-belts in case we should be travelling by
water. As only one of the Goyaz men could swim,
I had gladly given them the money to purchase those
articles. On our first day of navigation the men
amused me very much, as they all appeared garbed in
their life-belts, as if we had been going to the rescue of
a stranded ship in a tempest. I laughed heartily at
the sight. The intense heat of the sun made the heavy
cork belts so uncomfortable for them, that they discarded
them when they saw that the canoe would
actually float on the water, and packed them away
inside a wooden box, which they then screwed down
tight. The belts remained in that box most of the time,
except one day when a man put one on, as I had given
him instructions to go some way off in the centre of
the stream where the current was rather swift. By
misadventure he lost his footing, and had we not been
quick in going to his rescue he certainly would have
been drowned.</p>

<p>We tested the life-belts, and I found that not only
would they not float after they had been a minute or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-87" id="Pg_2-87"></a>[<a href="./images/2-87.png">87</a>]</span>
two in the water, but they became so heavy when
soaked with moisture that they would have dragged
to the bottom even a fair swimmer. They were
evidently old discarded ship belts. The cork, enclosed
in a canvas cover, had got decomposed and
pulverized, and therefore rendered useless.</p>

<p>As we are referring to the strange ways of looking
at things by different nations, I might as well include
the endless arguments I had with my men in selecting
our camps. I naturally always selected the cleanest
spots with a flat ground, so that the tents could be
pitched satisfactorily without extra trouble, where
there was little vegetation, and where the water was
good. My men always quarrelled over this, and insisted
on stopping in the filthiest places, either where
some trees, rotted away, had fallen down, where the
vegetation on the edge of the river needed cutting,
and where the ground had to be levelled before I could
pitch my camp bed. They always preferred sleeping
under the stifling vegetation to where there was an
open space and we had the clear sky over us.</p>

<p>They all slept in hammocks&mdash;the favourite resting
arrangement of the Brazilian&mdash;to my mind the most
uncomfortable and absurd fashion of resting, especially
in tropical regions. First of all, it is almost an impossibility
to assume a perfectly horizontal position for
your entire body, except&mdash;if you are an expert&mdash;diagonally;
then there is always a certain amount of
swing and you are likely to tumble over at any moment;
you can never keep the blankets in position, and you
expose your entire body to the stings of the mosquitoes,
flies and other insects, and of the ants which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-88" id="Pg_2-88"></a>[<a href="./images/2-88.png">88</a>]</span>
crawl into your hammock by hundreds from the trees
in which they swarm. It was not uncommon when
we camped to hear during the night a crash,
followed immediately after by oaths. The tree to
which one of the hammocks had been fastened had
suddenly broken and let the man down with a bump.
Then again, the mischievous ants took the greatest
delight during the night in cutting the strings of the
hammocks, and on several occasions my followers had
nasty falls. Yet the Brazilians swear by hammocks.</p>

<p>Another stream 2 m. wide, coming from the north,
entered the Arinos on the right bank. A number of
<i>ariranhas</i>, attracted by the vivid red of the British
flag which was flying at the stern of the canoe, followed
us for some time and came courageously to the attack,
showing their teeth fiercely at us and snarling frantically.
Entire families of those delightful little creatures
were seen, and they invariably gave us a similar
hearty greeting. They followed us sometimes for
hundreds and hundreds of metres, and became most
excited when I took the flag and waved it at them,
and sometimes placed it near the water in order to
drive them frantic.</p>

<p>We now had most beautiful forest on both sides.
A stream 5 m. wide joined the Arinos on the left side
from the west, forming a charming little waterfall as
it entered the main stream. A little farther on the
right was another streamlet, coming from the south-east.
Generally, as in this case, when we reached
tributary streams of any importance, gravel banks extended
and blocked a great part of, sometimes even
half, the main stream.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-89" id="Pg_2-89"></a>[<a href="./images/2-89.png">89</a>]</span>
A picturesque stream, 8 m. wide, coming from the
north-east, was then reached on the right side. It
flowed through a rocky gate. Five or six kilometres
farther on a tiny streamlet dribbled into the Arinos,
and also another, 1 m. wide, on the left bank.</p>

<p>At noon that day the sky was extraordinarily interesting.
From the north-west extended a wonderful
succession of loop coils of transparent mist, giving the
sky the appearance of a peacock's extended tail.</p>

<p>Just before we halted for lunch we came to a charming
streamlet of delicious water, 2 m. wide, on the
right bank.</p>

<p>The days were getting warmer as we advanced
farther north. It was hot work sitting in the sun&mdash;105&deg;
F. that day&mdash;to take observations for latitude
and longitude. In the shade the thermometer registered
89&deg; F. Lat. 12&deg; 21&#8242;&middot;3 S.; long. 57&deg; 16&#8242; W.</p>

<p>After lunch, 2&frac12; kil. from our camp, we passed on
the left bank a delightful tributary coming from the
W.S.W. Its mouth was 8 m. wide, and poured forth
waters of the most beautiful emerald green.</p>

<p>Five hundred metres farther down another large
tributary, 30 m. wide, coming from the north-east, was
observed on the right bank. Farther still, the river
formed a large basin 300 m. wide. Lovely forest flourished
round the sweeping curve of the basin. There
was simply a solid mass of marvellously fresh foliage,
with hardly a break through which, it seemed, a human
being could pass. In that particular part the leaves
came right down to the water, but there was no reason
to suppose that they grew equally low inland.</p>

<p>The stream, which was 250 m. broad, showed farther<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-90" id="Pg_2-90"></a>[<a href="./images/2-90.png">90</a>]</span>
on an immense bank of gravel 700 m. long, which
rose above the surface in the shape of two long
islands&mdash;one 300 m., the other 400 m. in length.</p>

<p>We felt the heat considerably going down the river,
as we were always in the sun in the centre of the
stream, with a temperature seldom less than 105&deg; F.
Especially where thick forest was on both sides of us,
there seemed to be no air close to the water. When
we came to patches of chapada and open country we
could breathe a little better. Several were the tributary
streamlets to which we came that afternoon.
First we saw one rivulet, 1 m. wide, on the right bank,
then 13 kil. 500 m. farther on another affluent, 3 m.
wide, coming from the north-east, also on the right
bank; then 1,500 m. farther a rivulet &frac12; m. wide,
coming from the south-west (left bank); then 4,500 m.
farther a charming stream, 6 m. wide, coming from the
north, and meeting with the Arinos near an extensive
stony place with shallow and troublesome water. Strong
eddies formed at that spot. One more streamlet, 1 m.
wide, was reached that day on the right. It came from
the north-east.</p>

<p>The river had that day flowed almost continuously
in directions varying from north-west to north, barring
two sections where its course had been 10&deg; east of
north.</p>

<p>After passing the last tributary the river described
a sweeping curve, gradually turning so far back as to
flow in a south-westerly (240&deg; b.m.) direction.</p>

<p>There was there shallow water with gravel banks in
the centre of the stream. Curiously enough, we did not
notice so much rubber close to the river in that region,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-91" id="Pg_2-91"></a>[<a href="./images/2-91.png">91</a>]</span>
but in an excursion a short distance from the water
we came upon <i>Siphonia elastica</i> trees, not only along
the Arinos but also along the tributaries.</p>

<p>We halted that day at sunset, having gone 73 kil.
400 m.; which, although much less than the previous
days, was still fair going for us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night of July 16th was heavy, the thermometer
registering a minimum temperature of 62&deg;F. We
had great fun fishing during the early hours of the
night. In the morning we had hundreds of pounds of
fish spread upon the bank of the river, with many
excellent specimens of the <i>motimchun</i> fish&mdash;so called, I
believe, because of its noisy and rebellious habits.</p>

<p>The sky was overladen with clouds, and the west
showed radiations of light. We had gone 2,500 m.
from our camp when we came to a tributary stream on
the left side coming from the south. Four thousand
four hundred metres farther on, a hill-range 120 ft.
high, with heavy forest upon it, encircled a sweeping
curve on the left of us to the west and north-west. The
cliff of this range, eroded by the river, showed rock of
a vivid red right up to its highest point, laminated in
perfectly horizontal layers, each 10 ft. thick. Farther
on a great basin 350 m. wide and of great beauty had
formed.</p>

<p class="figcenter">(Author's sextant in foreground.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Some 10 kil. beyond a beautiful beach of white
sand was noticeable on the left bank. We were always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-93" id="Pg_2-93"></a>[<a href="./images/2-93.png">93</a>]</span>
glad to see these beaches, as we frequently found on
them quantities of tortoise eggs&mdash;most delicious to eat.</p>

<p>An island&mdash;Gabriella Island&mdash;200 m. long divided
the river into two channels, the larger one of which&mdash;200
m. wide&mdash;we followed; the other being but 30 m.
broad and much strewn with rocks. The river, from
the point where we met the sand beach, flowed in a
S.S.W. direction for 6,500 m., when it gradually resumed
its course northward. The island, thickly
wooded, was extremely beautiful, with trees of great
size upon it. Quantities of <i>ariranhas</i> were to be found
near this island, and they came straight for us with
their mouths open, shrieking wildly and snarling and
spitting like cats. I was always amazed at their
bravery, as they came right on while being shot at by
my men, the reports of the rifles enraging them to
absolute frenzy.</p>

<p>Shortly after we came to another most beautiful,
oval-shaped island, 350 m. long&mdash;Maude Island&mdash;in a
basin extending from east to west for a breadth of not
less than 500 m.</p>

<p>Another island&mdash;Vera Island&mdash;150 m. long and of
an elongated shape, was seen in the same basin. It
also had luxuriant vegetation upon it, whereas, curiously
enough, the banks on either side of the great basin
showed <i>chapada</i> with stunted trees. Farther on, where
a small tributary entered the Arinos on the left side,
the country seemed quite open beyond the narrow
fringe of trees along the water.</p>

<p>Another streamlet 3 m. wide flowed into the Arinos
from the north-east on the right bank. The main river
there was of a width of 400 m.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-94" id="Pg_2-94"></a>[<a href="./images/2-94.png">94</a>]</span>
Another great island&mdash;Luiz Schnoor Island&mdash;also
most beautiful, like the others, was next seen. We
halted on it for our midday meal, and to take the usual
astronomical observations. The sky had, by that
time, become beautifully clear, of a dense cobalt blue,
and I was able to take twenty-three sights of the sun.
I generally took a great many sights with the sextant
and artificial horizon, in order to define the latitude
and longitude with greater accuracy. We were then
in lat. 11&deg; 38&#8242;&middot;4 S.; long. 57&deg; 35&#8242; W.</p>

<p>Gorgeous <i>gamelleira</i> or <i>figueira</i> trees (<i>ficus</i>) were to
be seen on that island, standing high up upon arches
formed by vigorous roots. In a way the lower part of
those <i>figueiras</i> resembled a huge octopus, the branches
being extremely contorted as they clung to the ground
in order to support the weight of the giant tree of
which they made part. One could easily walk under
the tree among the roots and still have six or eight feet
of space left above one's head.</p>

<p>As I went round to explore the island while my
men were cooking the dinner, I discovered a small lake
in the centre of the island&mdash;a most poetic spot, with
its neat, delightful vegetation all round it reflected as
in a mirror in the golden waters which reproduced in
a deeper tone the rich sunset tints of the sky above. I
sat myself down to look at the beautiful scene. The
poetry vanished at once. There were millions of
ants which swarmed all over me the moment I sat
down upon the ground, and bit me with such fury that
I had to remove my clothes in the greatest haste and
jump into the water. That raised a cloud of mosquitoes,
which made it most uncomfortable for me when I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-95" id="Pg_2-95"></a>[<a href="./images/2-95.png">95</a>]</span>
came out again and was busy searching for ants in my
clothes.</p>

<p>My men killed a beautiful long-armed spider monkey.
I was sorry, as I had watched the wonderful jumps of
this animal from one tree to another. Using the impetus
of the swing which they could obtain from the
immense length of their arms, as well as the swing of
the branch on which they were hanging, they could
fly enormous distances through the air. The span
from hand to hand in proportion to the size of the body
was really amazing.</p>

<p>Luiz Schnoor Island was 450 m. long. Plenty of
rubber trees were to be seen on the right bank of the
river after passing this great island, especially where
the river described a large sweeping curve towards the
north-east.</p>

<p>Farther on, close to the right bank, an island 100 m.
long and 5 ft. high, of yellow sand and gravel, showed
brilliantly with its vivid colouring upon the blue waters
of the river. For identification' sake I named it Gravel
Island on the map I was making of the river. I seemed
to be in fairyland&mdash;but for the company of my men&mdash;as
I floated down the stream, there 400 m. wide.</p>

<p>We had gone hardly 4 kil. when we came to another
ideal island&mdash;Margherita Island&mdash;400 m. long and
200 m. wide, with magnificent trees upon it. A
small stream joined the Arinos on the left side. Lower
down stream we had thin forest on both sides, with
some remarkable <i>oleo</i> trees, with their minute grey
leaves and the branches, laden with red berries,
drooping&mdash;weeping-willow-like&mdash;right down in the water.</p>

<p>Next we came to sand and gravel banks with islets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-96" id="Pg_2-96"></a>[<a href="./images/2-96.png">96</a>]</span>
1 ft. high emerging from the water in the centre of the
river, all those little islets displaying verdant grass on
their southern side and pure white sand on the northern
side.</p>

<p>The river was at that point flowing in a N.N.E.
direction. Then came a long straight line of 6,000 m.
of river flowing to 305&deg; b.m. About half-way through
this long stretch the stream divided into two large
arms, one in direct continuation of the above bearings,
the other in a curve, encircling an island 1,000 m.
broad. The basin&mdash;as still as a lake&mdash;in which this
island was situated was not less than 1,500 m. across.
The island&mdash;Charles Landor Island&mdash;was 2,000 m. in
length. It had plenty of rubber trees upon it, and
plenty were to be seen also on the banks. We went
some 8 or 10 kil. farther that night, and at five o'clock
we halted, having made poor progress that day&mdash;only
60 kil.</p>

<p>Immense quantities of fish could be seen in the
river. No sooner had we made camp than we got
out lines and hooks of all sizes, which we baited with
pieces of <i>toucinho</i>. One end of the bigger lines we
made fast to trees, as the fish we often caught were so
powerful that on several occasions they had dragged
us into the water and we lost not only the fish but the
line as well. We had great sport that night and caught
quantities of <i>trahira</i> (<i>Macradon trahira</i>)&mdash;not unlike a
giant salmon and quite as good to eat; and also some
<i>surubim</i> (<i>Platystoma Lima</i>), a large fish belonging to the
herring family. The surubim was flat-headed, and
not unlike the pintado fish which I have described in a
previous chapter. It had thin scales over the body,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-97" id="Pg_2-97"></a>[<a href="./images/2-97.png">97</a>]</span>
and an abnormally powerful lower jaw, with vicious-looking,
sharply-pointed teeth on the edge of the upper
and lower lip. These curiously situated teeth were far
apart, and so firmly inserted in the hard lips that it
took a violent blow to remove them.</p>

<p>Although after a few minutes we had killed fish
enough to last us&mdash;had we been able to preserve it&mdash;for
some weeks, my men sat up the greater part of the
night hauling quantities to the bank. The excitement
each time a fish 80 or 100 lb. in weight was hauled out
of the water was considerable. The wild yells and exquisite
language whenever one of my men was dragged
into the water kept me awake the entire night.</p>

<p>We left that camp at 7.30 on July 17th, the minimum
temperature having been 66&deg; F. during the night.
Heavy globular clouds covered the entire sky. We
were then in a region extraordinarily rich in rubber;
quantities of <i>Siphonia elastica</i> trees were to be seen.
It made one's heart bleed to think that nobody was
there to collect the riches of that wonderful land.</p>

<p>The river flowed in short sections from north-west
to north-north-east, barring a long stretch of 4,000 m.,
when we came to a great basin 600 m. wide, with two
large islands in it; the eastern island&mdash;Orlando Island&mdash;being
100 m. wide, the western&mdash;Elizabeth Chimay
Island&mdash;220 m. broad and not less than 500 m. long.
South of both these islands were islets of gravel 50 m.
each in diameter.</p>

<p>Nine thousand five hundred metres below these
islands an important tributary, 8 m. wide, flowed into
the Arinos from the right bank. It came from the
south-east. Close to the left bank, from which it had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-98" id="Pg_2-98"></a>[<a href="./images/2-98.png">98</a>]</span>
been separated by the current, leaving a channel only
5 m. wide, another island&mdash;Isabel Island&mdash;300 m. long
was found.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards we came to a big equilateral-triangular
island&mdash;Armida Island&mdash;fully 1 kil. a side.
Albert Island, next to it, was of a narrow elongated shape.</p>

<p>From the beginning of Armida Island the river flowed
for 4,000 m. in a direct line to 310&deg; b.m. Four large
rocks in a cluster stood in the centre of the stream at
the north-north-westerly end of the island. Then we
had another stretch of 4,300 m., during which the river
was squeezed through a narrow neck, 100 m. wide, between
low rocks. Immediately afterwards we emerged
into a bay 800 m. broad, with three islets on one side of
it. They were rather dry and somewhat mean-looking.
I called them Faith, Hope, and Charity Islands.</p>

<p>After that the river was 800 m. wide. A deposit
of gravel some 300 m. long was exposed on the right
side beyond the last island of the group.</p>

<p>Three kilometres farther we halted for an hour or
so, just time enough for me to take the latitude and
longitude and for our lunch to be cooked. The usual
torture had to be endured from the innumerable insects.
The heat was also terrible&mdash;107&deg; F. in the sun, 93&deg;
in the shade. Lat. 11&deg; 23&#8242;&middot;9 S.; long. 57&deg; 39&#8242; W.</p>

<p>When we left, we saw 3,500 m. beyond our halting
place, beside a great heap of rocks on the left side of the
river, a rivulet, 3 m. wide, entering the Arinos on the
left.</p>

<p>From that spot the river was contracted from a
width of 800 m. to one of only 120 m. Naturally the
water was of great depth and the current swift.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-99" id="Pg_2-99"></a>[<a href="./images/2-99.png">99</a>]</span>
Two great volcanic rocks stuck out in the centre
of the stream, and two extensive heaps of volcanic
rock stood on the right side of us, the rocks being at all
angles in a confused mass. Where these rocks were&mdash;a
spot which my men called the "porteira" or gateway&mdash;the
river turned sharply from 70&deg; b.m. to 290&deg; b.m.
The water seemed almost stagnant there, and we had
to make a great effort to get on. It seemed as if
there had been an undercurrent pushing us back.
The water was surely held up by some obstacle, and I
feared we had at last reached the extensive rapids
which I had expected for some days. Rocks were to
be seen in abundance all along, and three more sets of
giant boulders were reached, one after the other, in the
centre of the river, there only 150 m. broad. Strange
heaps of broken-up boulders of immense size were to
be seen on the right bank; then farther on more great
heaps in confusion on the left bank.</p>

<p>A tiny rivulet found its way among the rocks on
the right side. The channel was much strewn with
dangerous submerged rocks. I thought I would take
the navigation into my own hands for a little while,
and found a comparatively easy channel on the left
side of the river close to the bank.</p>

<p>As I had expected, the rumbling noise of troubled
waters was getting louder and louder, and the whitish
mist which rose above the horizon line was an unmistakable
sign that we had come to a dangerous spot.
Soon after, in fact, we arrived at a large circular
basin, some 600 m. in diameter, with rocks in the
centre of it. Two clusters of magnificent rocks, 30 ft.
high, towered on the left side of the river. Then came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-100" id="Pg_2-100"></a>[<a href="./images/2-100.png">100</a>]</span>
a long row of rocks, also gigantic, and a sandy beach
which had accumulated against them. A little farther
another great mass of rocks in disorder stood up against
the now once more fierce current.</p>

<p>We made our way tentatively along what seemed to
us the safest channel, to 320&deg; b.m., and with trepidation
shot the rapids, which were quite fearsome. I
must say for my men that by now they had acquired
a certain amount of courage&mdash;courage, like all things,
being a matter of training after all. We went down
at a terrific speed amidst the splashing waters, shaving
dangerous rocks and escaping collision by miracle.
When we got to the bottom of the rapid we were shot
into the whirlpool, which we might have avoided with
ease had Alcides obeyed the orders I shouted to him.</p>

<p>When I had shot the rapids before in other countries,
I had always avoided getting into the centre of
the whirlpool; but Alcides, who had never navigated a
river before, held the contrary idea, and always insisted
on steering the canoe right into the centre of those
dangerous rotating waters.</p>

<p class="fsc">In Shallow Water.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was sufficient to remonstrate as I did, for Alcides
to do a thing over and over again with the persistency
of a mule, in order to maintain what he thought was his
<i>amour-propre</i>. As it was, on that occasion, the canoe
swerved round with such force that she nearly turned
over, and got so filled with water that we had to struggle
out of the difficulty as best we could and beach her, or
she would have sunk.</p>

<p>At that point an island 400 m. long and 50 m.
wide divided the river into two channels. The western
channel had a small island of white sand and many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-101" id="Pg_2-101"></a>[<a href="./images/2-101.png">101</a>]</span>
rocks on its southern side. Pretty yellow flowers grew
wherever a little earth had accumulated upon the rocks.</p>

<p>After going 1,800 m. we found a great basin 600 m.
wide with a rocky island and barrier right across it.</p>

<p>Farther on innumerable rocks of all sizes could be
seen on the left bank; and 1,500 m. beyond these, where
a solid rock rose in the centre of the stream, eddies of
wonderful power were produced in the stream.</p>

<p>We glanced at a magnificent island of rock on the
left side as we sped along swiftly with the current;
but we were so busy with the difficult navigation,
and expecting accidents at any moment&mdash;what else
could I expect with the disobedient, unpractical,
obstinate crew I had with me?&mdash;that I had not much
time to admire the picturesqueness of the scenery.</p>

<p>I had quite foreseen that it was impossible to
avoid disaster sooner or later, so that all I could do
was to think of which would be the best way to minimize
its effects, when it did come.</p>

<p>In the great circular basin which was formed in
the river there was a passage to the west, which I did
not like at all, so I ordered my men to follow the
passage to the north-east. We met there violent
eddies which knocked the canoe about in a most alarming
manner soon after we had descended a short rapid
of some steepness.</p>

<p>Our baggage was simply soaked owing to the
amount of water we had shipped on various occasions
during the day. We saw ahead of us, only a short
distance off, a rapid of some magnitude. We decided
to halt at four o'clock in order that we might go and
explore on foot along the bank and see whether the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-102" id="Pg_2-102"></a>[<a href="./images/2-102.png">102</a>]</span>
canoe could be navigated down, or if we had better
unload her and let her down with ropes. We cut a
space in the forest, which was there thick, in order to
make our camp. We spread all our things to dry
during the night. The air was stifling&mdash;we had a
minimum temperature of 73&deg; F. (July 18th).</p>

<p>I took the accurate elevation of the camp with the
hypsometrical apparatus, water boiling at that spot at
210&deg;&middot;4, with the temperature of the air 73&deg; F.; altitude
1,113 ft. above sea level. I also took observations
for latitude and longitude: Lat. 11&deg; 17&#8242;&middot;5 S.; long.
57&deg; 37&#8242; W. We had to remain the entire morning in
order to cut a way through the forest and take part
of the most valuable baggage on men's backs until a
point below the rapids was reached.</p>

<p>We named that place Camp Jahu, as we caught
there several enormous fish of that name.</p>

<p>In a reconnaissance we made we found that from
Camp Jahu we had to take the canoe along among
innumerable rocks scattered in the only navigable
channel on the north side of a basin 700 m. wide, with
a large island 350 m. wide&mdash;Sarah Island&mdash;on the
southern side of the bay, and another smaller island
almost in the centre of the basin. There was a drop
2 ft. high&mdash;a regular step&mdash;in a barrier of sharply-pointed
rocks. We had some two hours' hard work
in order to get the canoe safely down. The rocks were
so close together that we could not find a passage large
enough for the canoe, and we actually had to pull her
out of the water over some rocks and then let her
down gently on the other side.</p>

<p>After leaving that great <i>pedraria</i> there was a clear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-103" id="Pg_2-103"></a>[<a href="./images/2-103.png">103</a>]</span>
basin 250 m. wide, ending where two enormous heaps
of rock formed a giant gateway. An island, 80 m.
wide&mdash;Rebecca Island&mdash;was found near the left cluster
of rocks. Another small island had formed close to
the right of the river. We descended by the north-easterly
passage, only 4 m. wide, where the current
was extremely swift but the rapid comparatively easy
to negotiate.</p>

<p>We then followed the channel flowing to 350&deg; b.m.,
and after passing innumerable rocks made our camp
again before coming to a large rapid which we heard
rumbling in that direction.</p>

<p>We had worked hard all that day, and all the progress
we had made by sunset was a distance of 2,000 m.&mdash;or
a little more than one mile.</p>

<p>Alcides, Antonio and I immediately proceeded to
cut a trail through the forest from that point down to
the end of the rapid, 1,200 m. farther down. Then we
proceeded to take all the baggage upon our shoulders&mdash;a
task which occupied several hours. I was greatly
surprised to find that the men did this willingly enough,
although they were unaccustomed to carrying and the
loads were heavy. They laughed heartily at one
another as they struggled under the heavy weights, or
trod upon thorns, or were jerked about with knocking
against trees&mdash;the passage we had cut being necessarily
not spacious.</p>

<p>I had not seen my men so jolly for a long time&mdash;in
fact, I do not remember ever having seen them so
jolly. I was in hopes that this state of affairs might
last, as it was certainly not pleasant to be travelling
in such usually morose company.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-104" id="Pg_2-104"></a>[<a href="./images/2-104.png">104</a>]</span>
During the night we caught an immense jahu,
weighing over 50 lb., as well as some 200 lb. of
smaller fish. As the bank of the stream was rather
high and steep, we had a great deal of trouble to land
the larger fish safely. Some of my men had exciting
experiences, one man falling into the water on receiving
a powerful blow from the tail of the struggling jahu.
The scene was a comic one, the terror of the man being
amusing to watch.</p>

<p>We carried a great quantity of salt; with it
my men set out to preserve the best portions of the
fish we had caught&mdash;a precaution of which I fully
approved.</p>

<p>I noticed that whenever we came across rocky
places the number of insects increased to an enormous
extent, especially mosquitoes and gnats. I think it was
due principally to the fact that in those rocks many
cavities were found which got filled with stagnant
water which eventually became putrefied.</p>

<p>The place where we halted we called Abelha Camp,
because of the millions of bees which worried us to
death there, not to speak of the swarms of flies, mosquitoes
and ants, and myriads of butterflies which came
to settle in swarms upon us. It was indeed curious
to note the wonderful tameness of the latter, as they
had never seen a human being before.</p>

<hr />
<p>There was a nasty-looking rapid close to the camp.
We had to let the empty canoe down carefully by
means of ropes, my men on that particular occasion
donning their lifebelts again, although they walked on
dry land when they were taking the canoe along.
When I asked them why they put them on, they said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-105" id="Pg_2-105"></a>[<a href="./images/2-105.png">105</a>]</span>
that perhaps the canoe might drag them into the
water and they had no wish to get drowned.</p>

<p>We left that camp late in the afternoon&mdash;at three
o'clock&mdash;having wasted the entire morning conveying
the canoe to a spot of safety and then carrying all the
baggage along overland.</p>

<p>After having gone some 2 kil. farther we came to
another rapid and a <i>pedraria</i> with nasty rocks right
across the channel, the only passage I could see possible
for our canoe being in the centre of the stream.
That channel was only a few metres wide, and had
in the centre of it a large rock just under the surface,
which flung the water up in the air. We just managed
to shoot that rapid safely, although with trembling
hearts.</p>

<p>Farther down, rocks innumerable, rising only two
or three feet above water, spread half-way across the
channel from the right side. Then rapids and strong
eddies were encountered. For 700 m. the river showed
foliated rock strewn all along on both banks, and great
volcanic boulders of a more rounded shape. The foliation
showed a dip westward of 45&deg;.</p>

<p>We were delighted when we discovered in that
region many <i>solveira</i> or <i>sorveira</i> trees, or milk trees,
exuding when incised milk most delicious to drink.
Then there were plenty of <i>figueiras</i> or <i>gameilleiras</i> and
wild bananas. We wasted much time extracting milk
from the <i>solveiras</i> and eating wild fruit.</p>

<p>Monkeys were to be seen in that part. They seemed
most astonished on perceiving us, and came quite close,
gazing at us in the most inquisitive manner.</p>

<p>We felt that we had come to a real heaven on earth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-106" id="Pg_2-106"></a>[<a href="./images/2-106.png">106</a>]</span>
except for the river, which could have given points to
the River Styx of infernal fame.</p>

<p>When we returned to the canoe we found obstructions
of all kinds in the stream. Small rapid succeeded
small rapid. Rocky islets and scattered rocks rendered
navigation complicated.</p>

<p>Where the river turned sharply to the N.N.E. another
dangerous rapid was reached, with rocks scattered
all over the channel, some just submerged. We tried
to shoot that rapid on the east side, but we got badly
stuck on a submerged rock, and once more the canoe
filled with water. It took us the best part of an hour
to extricate ourselves from our uncomfortable position.</p>

<p>A beautiful island 400 m. long and 200 m. wide&mdash;Maria
Island&mdash;was then reached. It had a long spur
of white sand at its south-easterly end, and pretty
vegetation upon it. Strange domes of rock were near
by, one particular dome of great size showing a spit
of white sand 70 m. long, on its north-westerly side.
Many other islets of rock rose above the water along the
bank of the larger island, while rapids of some magnitude
existed at the end of the island.</p>

<p>We hardly ever came to a stretch of placid water.
No sooner had we left the last rapid than, the river
turning sharply at that point, we went over a strong
<i>corrideira</i>, so strewn with obstacles that in the terrific
current we had a narrow escape of having our unmanageable,
long canoe smashed against one of the
innumerable rocks.</p>

<p>As we went on at a great speed I had just time to
notice rocks of all sizes and shapes along both banks,
and strange rocks in the middle of the river, one or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-107" id="Pg_2-107"></a>[<a href="./images/2-107.png">107</a>]</span>
two of them with stunted trees growing in fissures
which had become filled with earth.</p>

<p>Another island, 300 m. long&mdash;Martia Island&mdash;with a
picturesque spur of rock at its south-easterly end, was
next reached as we were going swiftly down a <i>corrideira</i>
in the channel to the right which we were following.</p>

<p>After the <i>corrideira</i>, as I was busy writing a description
of the landscape, I was thrown off my seat. My
men also had a similar experience, the canoe nearly
turning turtle and becoming filled with water. Alcides
had steered us right into the centre of a whirlpool.</p>

<p>These unexpected baths were not much to my taste&mdash;not
so much for the discomfort they caused my person,
as for the trouble they gave me in protecting my
notebooks and instruments. Also, in these accidents
we lost a considerable amount of our supply of salt,
which melted away in the water, and the supply of
flour and rice suffered from these unnecessary immersions.</p>

<p>A channel 30 m. wide separated Martia Island from
a second island&mdash;Camilla Island&mdash;100 m. long, which
must once certainly have formed part of it, but which
had been separated by the eroding waters of the stream.
Both islands were wooded, and were extremely pretty.
Great heaps of rock, 20 m. in diameter and even
more, occupied the centre of the stream after we had
passed the last island.</p>

<p>We had only gone 12 kil. 300 m. that day, so difficult
had been the navigation.</p>

<p>During the night in less than one hour we caught
two large <i>jahu</i>, one huge <i>pacu</i> (<i>Prochilodus argentius</i>),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-108" id="Pg_2-108"></a>[<a href="./images/2-108.png">108</a>]</span>
the latter shaped like a sole, but of a much greater size,
and with brilliant red patches on its body&mdash;a most
delicately-tasting fish to eat&mdash;and a number of large
<i>trahira</i> (<i>Machrodon trahira</i>), also called by the Brazilians
<i>rubaffo</i> because of the noise they make in the water.
Altogether over 200 lb. of fish were got out of the
water in less than sixty minutes.</p>

<p>We found many <i>jenipapeiros</i> (or <i>genipapeiro</i>) trees,
from the stewed bark of which we made excellent tea.
Its fruit was good to eat, and we used it for making
sweets.</p>

<p>During the night of July 19th the minimum temperature
was 67&deg; F.</p>

<p>We started off gaily enough in the morning, passing
first a great boulder, 10 m. in diameter, sticking right
out of the water; then an island 200 m. long contained
in a basin 500 m. wide. We left the island&mdash;Ruby
Island&mdash;which was 80 m. long, on our left, and went
down a channel with strong eddies and whirlpools.
Looking back at the eastern channel, we were glad we
had not followed it, as it was extremely rocky.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-108.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-108_th.jpg" alt="A Fine Cataract on the Arinos-Juruena River." title="A Fine Cataract on the Arinos-Juruena River." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">A Fine Cataract on the Arinos-Juruena River.</p>
<hr />
<p>The river was contracting in narrow necks and
expanding into large basins, another of these being
450 m. broad. A strong rapid existed here, owing to
the barrier formed across the stream by a central island
of rock and other boulders. After that came a basin
700 m. wide, with three islands&mdash;Teffe I., Nair I., Rock I.&mdash;in
its western part. The central and eastern passages
were difficult owing to the quantity of rocks which
stood in the way, so we took the canoe down the
channel from S.S.W. to N.N.E., which was also extremely
bad, and where we had to let her down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-109" id="Pg_2-109"></a>[<a href="./images/2-109.png">109</a>]</span>
with the greatest care by means of ropes, the baggage
having been previously unloaded. Even then the
canoe got filled with water. That involved a great loss
of time and waste of energy, so that we had to halt
longer than usual in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>Our halting place was most picturesque, situated on
volcanic rocks of great beauty, and overlooking a canal
cut into the rocks, with strong and foaming rapids from
east to west. Strong eddies formed at the end of the
rapids.</p>

<p>After leaving the camp and negotiating the rapids,
we came to an island 150 m. long&mdash;Magda Island&mdash;separated
by a rocky narrow channel from another
island, 50 m. long, west of it.</p>

<p>After the last rapid we were in a basin 800 m.
wide and 1,000 m. long. Strong <i>corrideiras</i> or rapids
occurred all the time, and rocks alone or in groups
standing wherever they were not wanted. Farther on
we came to another big basin, 1,000 m. wide, with a
square island on its western side. The island&mdash;Eva
Island&mdash;was 400 m. broad and of course of an equal
length.</p>

<p>Another island, triangular in shape, 700 m. long&mdash;Rose
Island&mdash;was then observed, after we had gone
over some strong rapids in the passage on the east
side of it.</p>

<p>The river was flowing in a northerly direction, and
shortly afterwards formed two channels&mdash;one north-west,
the other south-west&mdash;which soon joined again.</p>

<p>A beautiful bank of white sand 120 m. long and
4 ft. high stretched along the edge of the water on the
left side of us. Soon afterwards we entered an immense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-110" id="Pg_2-110"></a>[<a href="./images/2-110.png">110</a>]</span>
basin, 1,300 m. broad with a large island&mdash;May Island&mdash;on
its western side.</p>

<p>One kilometre farther the island ended at a
place where a lot of rocks stood out of the water. A
little lower down other rocks spread right across the
river in two parallel lines, forming very strong rapids,
which were shot, our canoe coming within an ace of
turning over.</p>

<p>The basin which followed was extremely rocky,
with strong whirlpools, most troublesome to negotiate.
Another island of irregular shape, 200 m. long and
200 m. wide&mdash;Rita Island&mdash;was found in a large basin,
1,000 m. broad, where we came to strong rapids and
violent eddies and whirlpools, the latter most dangerous-looking.
The water revolved with such force
that it formed in the centre of each vortex holes from
one to two feet in diameter.</p>

<p>The channel flowing north on the left side of the
river seemed the better of the two, but it was strewn
with rocks against which we had many collisions, owing
to the strong current, the unmanageable canoe and the
disobedient crew.</p>

<p>Another island 350 m. long&mdash;Eloisa Island&mdash;was to
the north-east of Rita Island. Fifteen hundred metres
farther on another <i>corrideira</i> occurred. A small tributary
entered the Arinos on the right side.</p>

<p>We were then travelling in a N.N.E. direction, the
river being in a straight line for some 3,000 m., in the
course of which we came to a small island on the left
side; then to a great island, 3,000 m. long&mdash;Albert Rex
Island&mdash;with beautiful forest upon it. There were two
other islets in this channel, one a mere cluster of rocks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-111" id="Pg_2-111"></a>[<a href="./images/2-111.png">111</a>]</span>
the other, north-east of the first and 150 m. in diameter&mdash;Belgium
Island&mdash;having pretty vegetation upon it.</p>

<p>A fourth and fifth&mdash;Laeken Island, 300 m. in
length, and Elizabeth R. Island, 5,000 m. in length&mdash;were
separated by a narrow channel. The latter had
most gorgeous vegetation upon it; so tidy was everything
in the thick forest, and the ground under it so
clean that you might have imagined yourself in an
English park.</p>

<p>Those islands were really too beautiful for words.
Not being a poet, I cannot find appropriate language to
describe their wonderful charm.</p>

<p>The river had a tendency to flow toward the west,
and even for 1 kil. in a south-westerly direction. It
had a width of 700 m. A small island 50 m. in diameter,
chiefly formed of accumulated rounded rocks
which had rolled down and deposits of gravel, had
formed in the centre of the stream. Beyond it a charming
little island, 180 m. long&mdash;Germaine Island&mdash;was
found, on which we made our camp. It had an extensive
gravel beach, on which I found beautiful crystals
and pebbles of wonderfully coloured marble.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> left at 8 a.m. on July 20th, the minimum temperature
during the night having been 57&deg; F. We had
hardly gone 1&frac12; kil. when we came to another island,
500 m. long&mdash;Mabel Island&mdash;quite as beautiful as the
one on which we had camped. Small rapids were encountered
where we just managed to avoid dangerous
submerged rocks close to the right bank, near the
entrance of a basin 900 m. wide.</p>

<p>All those basins were really magnificent to look at.
This one, for instance, displayed a lovely island&mdash;Noailles
Island&mdash;500 m. long, and 200 m. wide on its
left side. Picturesque rocks of a vivid red colour
peeped out of the water and broke the current, the
spray that rose in the air forming pretty rainbows.
There was a channel there, 300 m. wide, after passing
the last island. Then came one more great basin
700 m. wide, and yet another pretty island, with a
rocky spur.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Nasty Rapid.</p>
<hr />
<p>We followed a course of 10&deg; b.m. on the left side of
the island&mdash;Margie Island&mdash;which was 500 m. long,
and had a number of subsidiary islands formed by
picturesque groups of rock.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-113" id="Pg_2-113"></a>[<a href="./images/2-113.png">113</a>]</span>
We then came to one more great basin, with an
immense quantity of rock in its western part. Many
of the boulders showed a foliation in their strata with
a dip of 45&deg; east. The accumulation of boulders formed
a formidable barrier before we reached an island most
beautiful to gaze upon, so luxuriant was the vegetation
on it.</p>

<p>This particular island was 200 m. long; next to
it was another 150 m. long; then, joined to this
by a link of high rocks to the south-east, was a
third, also of considerable beauty. So charming were
these islands that I called the group the Three Graces
Islands.</p>

<p>The river turned due west from that point in
a channel of continuous rapids and violent eddies for some
3,000 m. We went down, the canoe being knocked
about in a most alarming way on one or two occasions,
and shipping so much water as to reach almost up to
our knees inside it.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that all my photographic plates,
note-books and instruments were in water-tight boxes,
or they certainly would have been damaged beyond
saving. This was not the case with my clothes, shoes,
and bedding, which had now been wet for many days
with no possibility of drying them, as we were travelling
all day long and every day, and during the night
the heavy dew prevented them from getting dry. Why
we did not get rheumatism I do not know, as not only
did we wear wet things all day long, but we slept in
blankets soaked with moisture.</p>

<p>The moment I dreaded most was that in which we
emerged from the rapid into the whirlpool which always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-114" id="Pg_2-114"></a>[<a href="./images/2-114.png">114</a>]</span>
followed, and in which the canoe swerved with such
terrific force that it was all we could do to hold on and
not be flung clean out of her&mdash;owing, of course, to the
centrifugal force as she revolved quickly.</p>

<p>Making a survey of the river was getting to be a
complicated and serious job, what with the numberless
islands we encountered, the continuous rapids, and
the constant changes of direction. I was busy writing,
as fast as I could&mdash;only interrupted momentarily by
involuntary shower-baths&mdash;prismatic compass and
watch in hand all the time, the latter in order to
measure the distances as accurately as possible.</p>

<p>We had now come to another group of islands in a
line in the centre of the river. They had been at one
time evidently all one, which had subsequently been
eroded into five separate islands and an extensive
bank of gravel and sand. Taken in succession from
south to north, there was first an oblong island, thickly
wooded, 120 m. long&mdash;Nina Island&mdash;having on its
western side an elongated bank of sand and gravel;
then, where a barrier of rocks stretched transversely
across the stream and where extremely bad rapids
occurred&mdash;three of them in succession, each worse than
the last&mdash;was another island&mdash;Providence Island&mdash;1,400
m. in length.</p>

<p>When we reached any rapid we had to be quick in
judging which was the best channel to follow, as the
current was so strong that we had not sufficient strength
to pull back against it. I generally selected the
channel, my men by this time having gained sufficient
confidence in my judgment, since so far we had had
no serious mishap. But I foresaw that we should soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-115" id="Pg_2-115"></a>[<a href="./images/2-115.png">115</a>]</span>
have an accident, as they were getting foolhardy, and
in their ignorance attributed the wonderful luck we
had had entirely to their own skill in navigation.</p>

<p>On that particular occasion we had hardly time to
recover from shooting the first rapid with the velocity
of an arrow, and were wet all over with the splash of
the water, when we came to the second and third rapids,
where the channel was so narrow and rocks were scattered
so near the surface, that it was really a marvel
to me how we got through without capsizing. The
men in their excitement were shrieking wildly as we
dashed through the foaming waters, and there were
also yells of positive terror from the man ahead, who
with a long pole in hand tried to save the canoe from
dashing now upon one rock then upon another.</p>

<p>Below the rapids the three other islands were Dora
Island, 200 m. long; Edna Island, 500 m. long; and
Lucia Island, 700 m. long.</p>

<p>The river was flowing in a westerly and south-westerly
direction, the banks showing a quantity of
rubber trees all along. A tiny islet 50 m. long had
been eroded from the right bank, just above a strong
<i>corrideira</i>, easily identifiable by later travellers who
may visit it, since a huge rock stands there in the
centre of the river.</p>

<p>On the left side of the river foliated rock 10 ft. high
was exposed for the length of 1 kil. Dense forest was
to be seen on both sides of the river all along the rapids.</p>

<p>Two more islands, each 100 m. in diameter&mdash;Romeo
and Juliet Islands&mdash;close to each other, were
then seen on one side of the main channel, which was
200 m. wide.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-116" id="Pg_2-116"></a>[<a href="./images/2-116.png">116</a>]</span>
From this point the river actually flowed in a
S.S.W. direction (230&deg; b.m.), and for 2,500 m. we had
to negotiate strong and troublesome rapids with
variations of shallow water, usually with a bottom of
sharp rocks. The water in many of those places, coming
with great force, hit the bottom and was thrown
up again in high waves which swamped our canoe
each time we went through them. In one place we got
stuck on a rock in the middle of the foaming waters,
and had a hard job to get the canoe off again and
prevent her sinking when we had done so.</p>

<p>Where the river turned for another 2 kil. 500 m.
more to the west, another elongated island rose on
the left side of the stream. The island&mdash;Laurita Island&mdash;was
only 80 m. broad, but had a total length of
1,800 m.</p>

<p>More rapids and shallow water above a bottom of
red volcanic d&eacute;bris were found. A small tributary
2 m. wide at the mouth entered the Arinos on the left
bank, not far from the spot where a rocky rugged island
rose in the centre of the stream.</p>

<p>I halted at 11.30 in order to take the usual observations
for latitude and longitude and soundings of the
river. The stream, which was 320 m. broad, below
some rapids, showed a depth of 6 ft. the entire way
across. Farther down, where it contracted to 200 m.
in breadth, it showed a depth of 8 ft. in the centre with
a maximum depth of 10 ft. to the right and left of it,
gradually decreasing to 5 ft., 3 ft., 2 ft., and 1 ft. as it
neared the banks. Lat. 11&deg; 7&#8242;&middot;3 S.; long. 57&deg; 46&#8242; W.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Giant Central Wave emerging from a Narrow Channel.</p>
<hr />
<p>When we resumed our journey after lunch, we
came to another thickly wooded island, 1,000 m. long,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-117" id="Pg_2-117"></a>[<a href="./images/2-117.png">117</a>]</span>
350 m. wide&mdash;J. Carlos Rodriguez Island&mdash;with a
cluster of huge rocks on its southern end.</p>

<p>We had a few minutes of comparatively easy
navigation, the river being extraordinarily beautiful in
straight stretches of 3,000 m., 2,000 m., and 3,000 m.,
to 340&deg;, 350&deg;, and 360&deg; (N.) bearings magnetic. In
the first 3,000 m. we came upon another strong rapid
over a barrier of rocks which extended right across
the stream. Beyond the rapids the usual troublesome
whirlpools occurred. A polished dome of rock 10 ft.
high emerged in mid-stream. Then another charming
island&mdash;Nona Island&mdash;with a spit of white sand at its
southern end rose gracefully out of the river. It had
a breadth of 100 m. and a length of 600 m.</p>

<p>More <i>corrideiras</i> and eddies had to be gone over
that day. We seemed to be spending our entire time
trying to avoid&mdash;not always successfully&mdash;collisions
with dangerous rocks. We came to another beautiful
island, 200 m. long and 100 m. wide&mdash;Emma Island&mdash;screened
at its southern end by high-domed volcanic
rocks, and soon after to a rocky island on our right,
separated by a narrow channel from a larger and
thickly wooded island, 300 m. long and 100 m. wide&mdash;Georgia
Island.</p>

<p>The rapids seemed to be getting worse and worse
as we went down the stream. After passing these
three islands we came to a most dangerous spot, the
rapids there being strewn all over with nasty-looking
rocks which did not seem to leave a clear passage
anywhere in a straight line. After 500 m. of anxious
travelling we encountered more rapids and troublesome
eddies. We had by that time got accustomed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-118" id="Pg_2-118"></a>[<a href="./images/2-118.png">118</a>]</span>
the danger, and even felt travelling dull and stupid
when we came to a few metres of placid water.</p>

<p>As we were going down a stretch of 3,000 m. to
350&deg; b.m. we found the centre of the river blocked by great
masses of rock; then, a little farther, rocks occupied the
left of the river. We went through a narrow passage
between those high rocks, finding ourselves carried
away helplessly into a rapid of alarming swiftness,
which subsequently shot us into a terrific whirlpool.</p>

<p>Alcides was steering us right into the centre of the
terrifying rotating waters, when I jumped up and,
seizing the steering gear out of his hands, was just
able to avoid disaster. As it was, the canoe switched
off at a tangent with a heavy list to port, leapt out of
the water like a flying fish, and when she dropped
again into the water was carried off at a great speed,
with a heavy list on and filling fast. I do not know
why she did not capsize altogether.</p>

<p>We then had rocks on the left side, rocks on the
right side; a barrier of many rocks across the entire
stream, with a thickly wooded island, 70 m. wide and
200 m. long&mdash;Lilian Island&mdash;on the left side. There
were a great many scattered rocks at the northern end
of the island, where a small rapid was found. Then
we were confronted by 4,000 m. of river in a straight
line. We had gone but 2,000 m. along that stretch
when we came to a lovely rectangular island, with
a spit of rock extending for 120 m. eastward, and
separated by a narrow channel from the island itself.
The island&mdash;Susan Island&mdash;was 100 m. broad and
250 m. long, with its fore-part of gravel as usual. It
was in a basin 500 m. wide.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-119" id="Pg_2-119"></a>[<a href="./images/2-119.png">119</a>]</span>
The river turned to the W.S.W., and was there
placid enough, although the current was swift. Where
the river flowed once more in a more northerly direction
we found rocks and two tiny wooded islands on the
left side of the stream, one 20 m., the other 70 m. long.
There a <i>corrideira</i> occurred soon after we had negotiated
a dangerous rapid&mdash;dangerous because of the number
of intricate rocks which forced the canoe to describe
a snake-like dance like a double S, bumping and swerving
with such force from the restless waters underneath,
that it was all we could do to prevent her turning
over.</p>

<p>In a basin 700 m. wide which was further crossed,
we admired a picturesque rocky island of a beautiful
emerald green colour in the centre of the stream. An
immense barrier of rock was on the north-east side of
this basin. Before we halted, absolutely worn out
by the heavy work of the day, we descended another
troublesome rapid&mdash;fortunately that time with no
mishaps of any kind.</p>

<p>At five o'clock we made our camp in the only spot
we could find that was suitable; but no sooner had we
landed than we were fiercely attacked by millions of
<i>sauba</i> or <i>carregadores</i> ants which gave us a lively time
during the entire night. Those ants, which were there
absolutely in millions, were from 1 in. to 1&frac14; in. in length,
and possessed powerful clippers on the head with
which they bit us, giving intense pain. When you
had thousands of them climbing up your legs and over
your body, and dropping upon you from the tree
branches which were alive with them, and clinging to
you with all their might once they had got you with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-120" id="Pg_2-120"></a>[<a href="./images/2-120.png">120</a>]</span>
their clippers, you began to think what a fool you had
been to leave your happy home in England.</p>

<p>As I shall have an opportunity of speaking at greater
length of the <i>saubas</i> later in this volume, I shall leave
them now, merely mentioning that during the entire
night we were unable to sleep owing to those brutes.
And that was not all: we had many of our clothes,
shoes, and other articles entirely destroyed by them.</p>

<p>We called that place Camp Carregador. The nights
had become by then quite stifling and damp, the
minimum temperature on July 21st being 63&deg; F.</p>

<p>No sooner had we started on our journey that
day than we came to rapids. A lot of rocks stood
everywhere in the stream. The river after that flowed
in a snake-like fashion for 5,000 m. in a general direction
N.N.E., and was there comparatively free from serious
obstacles. We came to a triangular island 700 m.
long&mdash;Ada Island&mdash;separated from a second island by
a channel 50 m. wide. This second island&mdash;Hugo
Island&mdash;formed an isosceles triangle of 800 m. each
side. These two islands were evidently at one time
joined together, forming a lozenge-shaped island, and
had been eroded in the centre by the back-wash of
the stream at the spot where it formed an angle.</p>

<p>Where the river turned from 315&deg; b.m. to 340&deg; b.m.,
it was much strewn with sharp cutting rocks. We were
thrown with great violence on one of these and very
nearly capsized. Great heaps of volcanic boulders
were now seen on the right side of the channel, and one
island 50 m. long&mdash;Nora Island&mdash;with a few shrubs
on it.</p>

<hr />
<p>A great heap of rock was fixed in the centre of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-121" id="Pg_2-121"></a>[<a href="./images/2-121.png">121</a>]</span>
stream, forming a kind of spur, beyond which a regular
barrier of rock spread from south-west to north-east
right across the stream. We had difficulty in finding
a suitable passage, but eventually got through close
to the right bank in a small <i>corrideira</i>, easily recognizable
by subsequent travellers, as by the side of it
was a rocky hill of a conical shape 30 ft. high with a
tuft of trees on its summit. On both banks of the
stream rubber trees were plentiful. For 5,000 m. the
river had been proceeding in a perfectly straight line
to the N.N.W.</p>

<p>My work was extremely tiring, as not only was
my time employed surveying the river carefully and
writing up plentiful notes, but also I had to control the
navigation as much as I could and be ready for any
emergency, owing to the capricious nature of my men
and their unbounded disobedience. Orders could not
be given direct, as they were always disobeyed, so that
to obtain what I wished I generally had to give the
contrary order. For instance, if I wanted to avoid a
rock I ordered Alcides to run the canoe on to the
rock; if I wanted to shoot a rapid I ordered them to
take the canoe down with ropes, and so on.</p>

<p>Innumerable rocks were now encountered all the
time. In places regular great tables or platforms of
polished rock were to be seen under the surface in the
clear water. A wonderful group of gigantic rocks was
then reached, with a most charming island peeping
through behind.</p>

<p>We came to an island 450 m. long and 30 m. wide&mdash;Anna
Island&mdash;where two more barriers of rock were
found right across the stream. Beyond, a bank 150 m.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-122" id="Pg_2-122"></a>[<a href="./images/2-122.png">122</a>]</span>
long of deliciously white sand was observed, where
some 2 kil. of placid navigation was gone through;
but no sooner had we covered that short distance than
strong eddies were again met with at the point where
the river expanded to a somewhat greater width.</p>

<p>After going almost due west for a short distance
the river gradually swung round to due north, a most
beautiful view opening before us as we got round the
sweeping curve. For 5,000 m. the river now ran in a
perfectly straight line, with its beautiful clear water
flowing over a rocky bed. In the far distance loomed
the first range of mountains we had seen since leaving
the Serra Azul. I had got so tired of gazing at a flat
horizon line that the sight of the range gave me unbounded
pleasure. But I had not much time to gaze
upon the scenery, for rocks of all sizes and shapes were
strewn all along the channel.</p>

<p>Two small islets, each 20 m. long, were passed on
the right bank. Then came more picturesque groups
of rock on the right and on the left of us as we paddled
gaily along, and refreshing accumulations of pure white
sand. Farther on, an island 50 m. wide and 60 m.
long, with a southerly crown of huge boulders&mdash;Corona
Island&mdash;was to be seen close to the right bank.</p>

<p>Some thousand metres before we got to the end
of the long stretch, yet another elongated island 50 m.
long lay close to the left bank. The island was thickly
wooded. From that spot a basin fully 1,000 m. broad
spread out. The easterly portion was a mass of
rock, exposed a few feet above the surface. These
rocks extended right across the basin as far as an
island 350 m. long&mdash;Josephine Island. The vegetation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-123" id="Pg_2-123"></a>[<a href="./images/2-123.png">123</a>]</span>
was indescribably beautiful in that part. Immense
quantities of rubber trees stood majestically, so far
unknown and untouched in the luxuriant forest.</p>

<p>Eight distinct groups of rocks were found on the
right-hand side of the river where it flowed for 4,000 m.
in a N.N.W. direction. I took forty-two sights of the
sun that day in order to determine the exact latitude
and longitude. Lat. 10&deg; 48&#8242;&middot;9 S.; long. 58&deg; 0&#8242; W.</p>

<p>When we left again in the afternoon the river, there
350 m. broad, was enchantingly beautiful, absolutely
clear of obstacles as far as we could see. There was a
stretch of 4,000 m. of placid waters, and we imagined
that we had come to the end of our trouble.</p>

<p>Monkeys played gaily among the trees, evidently
taking the greatest interest in the canoe. They followed
us for long distances, jumping from tree to tree,
shrieking with excitement and gazing at us with keen
interest. We in the canoe suffered perfect torture
from the millions of bees, gnats, and mosquitoes, which
settled on us in absolute swarms and stung us for all
they were worth. The lips, eyelids, nose and ears
seemed to be their favourite spots for drawing blood&mdash;perhaps
because the remainder of the face and neck
was already a mass of stings and the skin had got
hardened and parched by the broiling sun. The temperature
was warm&mdash;92&deg; F. in the shade, and 103&deg;
in the sun.</p>

<p>At the end of the 4,000 m. another great mass of
rocks was found extending from south to north right
across the stream. Fortunately we found a channel
sufficiently large for navigating our canoe exactly in
the centre of the river. After turning to the W.N.W.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-124" id="Pg_2-124"></a>[<a href="./images/2-124.png">124</a>]</span>
we found a charming little rocky islet with a solitary
tree upon it, and 1 kil. farther a larger island 400 m.
long and 300 m. wide in the shape of a triangle&mdash;Sylvia
Island. This island was separated by a channel 70 m.
wide from an immense island&mdash;Guanabara Island&mdash;6,400
m. long. The channel we followed, the river
there flowing to the S.S.W., was 300 m. wide. Great
masses of rock were visible on the left side. Where
the river flowed in a more westerly direction rocks
formed a barrier right across from south-east to north-west.</p>

<p>Then the river once more flowed in a S.S.W. direction
through a perfectly beautiful channel. A lovely
sand and gravel beach extended from north-east to
south-west at the turn of the river where the great
Guanabara Island ended.</p>

<p>Some 600 m. farther on a huge dome of rock like
a spherical balloon was to be seen, with two smaller
rocks by its side. A basin 400 m. wide was then found
with an islet of sand 100 m. long on the left side, and
a low islet of gravel partly wooded on the right side
of the channel. These preceded another accumulation
of sand and gravel 100 m. long with a few trees upon it,
which was succeeded by a mass of rocks just before
reaching a fair-sized island.</p>

<p>Another great spherical rock was seen before entering
the channel between the island and the left bank.
In the extensive bay great boulders of indescribable
beauty were visible.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Canoe being led down a Rapid.</p>
<hr />
<p>Several <i>capivaras</i> were basking in the sun on the
top of the boulders, and were fired at many times by
my men as they stood up to gaze at us in astonishment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-125" id="Pg_2-125"></a>[<a href="./images/2-125.png">125</a>]</span>
before they made up their minds to jump into the water
and escape.</p>

<p>Close to those rocks an island&mdash;Teresa Island&mdash;400
m. long was next admired. Strong rapids had to
be gone through in a great barrier of rocks at the end
of this island. Then no sooner were we thanking our
stars that we had negotiated that portion of our journey
safely than we were among a lot of globular boulders,
some 30 ft. high.</p>

<p>For 800 m. we had a placid time, the water of the
stream being so beautifully green, so transparent, that
we could see the bottom quite clearly. Our happiness
did not last long. We had more rapids and a great
rocky bank spreading from south-east to north-west
right across the stream, and forming in one portion
an island.</p>

<p>We went down another strong rapid between great
and dangerously situated rocks and a large island.
Then came another wonderful group of high domed
rocks, one of the great domes displaying a sharp northern
spur like the ram of a battleship. Next to it were
three cylindrical rocks, just like towers, one of which
leant over the dome.</p>

<p>Yet another rapid was shot through with no misadventure,
and when we came to the end of a large
island 4,500 m. long and 80 m. wide&mdash;Priscilla Island&mdash;preceded
by a smaller islet of sand and gravel, we
arrived at a direct stretch of 4,000 m. of river, flowing
to the west. Another rocky islet with an accumulation
of sand and a lot of scattered rocks by its side, then
a high island, were passed on our right, and farther on
we found another great group of globular rocks at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-126" id="Pg_2-126"></a>[<a href="./images/2-126.png">126</a>]</span>
the point where Daphne Island, 350 m. in length,
began.</p>

<p>I hardly had time to map out the numberless rocks
and islands we met before we came upon others. There
again we saw three more islands in succession&mdash;Mars
Island, 500 m. long and 100 m. wide; Jupiter Island,
250 m. long; and a third and smaller one, separated
from the second by a channel strewn with huge boulders.</p>

<p>To the N.N.W., at 340&deg; b.m., we saw a hill 300 ft.
high, some distance from the stream. Innumerable
rocks again occurred in the centre of the channel, and
then we came to an extensive triangular island&mdash;Barretos
Island&mdash;the base of which was 300 m. Its
left side was 2,000 m. long, its eastern or right side
about 1,500 m. A hill range some 300 ft. high was
looming before us to the north-east. The second
island&mdash;Antonio Prado Island&mdash;had a total length of
2,000 m. with an average width of 200 m.</p>

<p>On this magnificent island we halted at five o'clock
in the afternoon, and I took altitude observations with
the hypsometrical apparatus: 1,062 ft. above the sea
level.</p>

<p>We were again lucky in fishing that evening. We
caught six <i>trahiras</i>, several <i>pacus</i>, and two young <i>jahus</i>&mdash;altogether
some 120 lb. in weight. My men had
wasted so much food, and so much had been spoiled by
constant immersions&mdash;many of the tinned meats had
been altogether spoiled by the tins having got rusty
and gradually perforated&mdash;that I was beginning to feel
rather anxious in case our journey should last longer
than I expected. Unfortunately, we had lost most of
our salt, and we had no way of preserving the fish,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-127" id="Pg_2-127"></a>[<a href="./images/2-127.png">127</a>]</span>
which we had to leave on the banks, absolutely wasted.
In order, however, to show how lazy my men were, it
is enough to say that, rather than take the slight
trouble of placing some pieces of the excellent fish on
board the canoe instead of trusting entirely to the luck
we might have in fishing the next evening, they had
to go the entire day without food. For some reason
or other we could not get a single fish to bite, and we
did not find a single bird or monkey to shoot.</p>

<p>I was rather interested to observe, in looking over
my notes, that nearly all the rocky barriers we had met
stretching across the river extended from south-east to
north-west. I believe that similar barriers stretched
in the same direction in the other southern tributaries
of the Amazon, the Xingu and the Madeira Rivers, but,
curiously enough, this was not the case with the River
Araguaya.</p>

<p>We had made our camp that particular night on a
lovely beach of white sand, which I found perfectly
delicious, but which my men hated, as there were no
trees on which they could hang their hammocks. They
did not like to go into the luxuriant forest of the
beautiful island, as they were afraid to go too far away
from me, and I did not wish to go too far away from
the canoe, which we had beached on the gravel bank,
in case the river should rise suddenly or something
should happen to make her float away. As I have
said, I never, during the entire journey, let that canoe
go out of my sight for one single moment. The men,
therefore, went into the forest to cut big poles, which
they afterwards planted with much exertion, in the
sand near my camp-bed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-128" id="Pg_2-128"></a>[<a href="./images/2-128.png">128</a>]</span>
Some amusing scenes happened during the night,
when the poles gradually gave way with the weight
of the men in the hammocks, and, tumbling down
altogether, gave them severe blows on their heads
and bodies.</p>

<p>The stars were simply magnificent in brilliancy as
I lay on my camp-bed. One particularly, to 290&deg; b.m.
N.W.&mdash;the planet Venus&mdash;was extraordinarily brilliant,
appearing six times as big as any other planet visible
that night. It threw off radiations of wonderful
luminosity, quite strong enough to illuminate with a
whitish light a great circular surface of the sky around it.</p>

<p>In the morning, before we left, Alcides&mdash;who loved
carving names and inscriptions on every tree and stone&mdash;duly
incised the name of Antonio Prado, with which
I baptized the island in honour of the greatest Brazilian
living, upon a giant <i>figueira</i> tree on the southern edge
of the extensive beach of sand and gravel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night was heavy and damp. All our things were
soaked in the morning with the dew which had fallen.
We were enveloped in a thick mist when we woke up.
It became a dense fog when the sun rose, and did not
clear up until the sun was fairly high above the horizon.
The minimum temperature during the night had
been 62&deg; F. (July 22nd).</p>

<p>We were unable to leave until eight o'clock, as the
river was dangerous enough when we could see where
we were going, and it would have been rather foolish
to add one more risk to our travelling in the fog.</p>

<p>My men were extremely irritable and morose that
morning, and even our dogs were most troublesome.
We had had a great deal of trouble with the dogs;
they were as disobedient and untrainable as the men.
Nearly every morning we had to waste a considerable
time in getting the animals back into the canoe.
When we were ready to start they generally dashed away
into the forest and the men had to go and fetch them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-130" id="Pg_2-130"></a>[<a href="./images/2-130.png">130</a>]</span>
and bring them back. That particular morning one
dog&mdash;the best we had&mdash;escaped, and my men searched
for more than an hour, but were unable to find him.
In trying to run after him they got their feet full of
thorns, and they became so enraged that they decided
to abandon the dog on the island. I called him for
more than half an hour, trying to save his life, but the
animal refused to come. So, much to my sorrow, we
had to pull out without him, and undoubtedly the
poor beast eventually must have died of starvation,
as there was no food whatever to be obtained in the
forest on the island.</p>

<p>The dogs were quite amusing to watch while in the
canoe, their terror when we shot rapids being quite
manifest. They were an additional source of danger
to us, for once or twice while shooting rapids strewn
with rocks they would jump out of the canoe on to the
rocks as we were shaving past them, and we lost much
time on several occasions in order to rescue them. In
going through the forest the poor animals had suffered
much from the attacks of ants and all kinds of insects,
many parasites having got inside their ears and where
the skin was softer under their legs, causing terrible
sores.</p>

<p>They never got fond of anybody, no matter how
well they were treated. In fact, unlike all other dogs
of any other country, they never seemed even to
recognize any of us. Alcides had become the owner of
the abandoned dog in a peculiar way at the beginning
of our journey, when travelling with my caravan of
mules. The dog was going along with a man travelling
in the opposite direction to ours. Alcides, who at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-131" id="Pg_2-131"></a>[<a href="./images/2-131.png">131</a>]</span>
time was eating some bread, whistled to the dog, and
from that moment the animal left his master and came
along with us.</p>

<p>Perhaps Brazilian dogs do not give affection because
they never receive any. They were so timid that
when you lifted your hand to caress them they would
dash away yelling, with their tails between their legs,
as if you had been about to strike them. I tried time
after time to make friends with them&mdash;and I am generally
quick at making friends with animals&mdash;but I gave
up in despair the hope of gaining the slightest affection
from those dogs.</p>

<p>When we came to the end of the island we found
another great barrier of foliated rock extending from
east to west, 500 m. across. The basin showed, moreover,
three sets of giant rocks on the left side. In
the north-easterly part where the river narrowed again
there stood a range of hills 300 ft. high, extending from
west to east, and parallel to the rocky barrier across
the basin. A streamlet 3 m. wide coming from the
south-west entered the Arinos from the left bank. The
hill range which stood along the right bank of the river
showed a rocky formation of a greyish colour right up
to its summit, and was, in fact, a mere great rocky
barrier with only a few trees growing in interstices
which had been filled with earth and sand. The
southern aspect of the range was an almost vertical
wall.</p>

<p>The river was proceeding mostly in a westerly and
north-westerly direction for long stretches of 3,500 m.,
4,000 m., 2,000 m., until we came to an equilateral-triangular
island, 300 m. each side&mdash;Erminia Island.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-132" id="Pg_2-132"></a>[<a href="./images/2-132.png">132</a>]</span>
A small channel not more than 20 m. across separated
this from an irregularly-shaped island, 600 m. long&mdash;Niobe
Island. After this came a low island of sand
and gravel 5 ft. high and 300 m. long, with merely a
few trees upon it, whereas the other two islands were
covered with dense and most beautiful vegetation.
The main channel of the river was 400 m. wide.</p>

<p><i>Araras</i> (macaws) of great size and of a beautiful
vermilion colour flew overhead, shrieking wildly at
the sight of us. We began to find a great many <i>jacar&eacute;s</i>
(<i>Caiman fissipis</i>) or crocodiles. I saw one sleeping
placidly on an islet of gravel. I landed and photographed
it, subsequently waking it with a start by
throwing a stone at it. My men, who were following
cautiously behind me, opened a fusillade and killed it.</p>

<p>It was really amusing to watch the astonishment of
the few animals and birds we met in that deserted part
of Brazil, as none of them had seen a human being.
They evidently did not know what to make of us.
They generally looked with curiosity and surprise,
and my men could fire shot after shot before they would
attempt to run, or, if they were birds, fly away.</p>

<p>There were in that region some fine specimens of
the <i>cigana</i> (<i>Opisthocomus cristatus</i>) and of the <i>jac&uacute;</i>
(<i>Penelope cristata</i>). The <i>cigana</i> was beautiful to look
at, with brown and yellow stripes, not unlike a pheasant,
and a tuft of bright yellow feathers on the head. All
of a sudden we came upon great numbers of these birds,
and they supplied us with good meals.</p>

<hr />
<p>There were again plenty of rubber trees in the
forest, plenty of fish in the river. The climate was
not too hot&mdash;merely 87&deg; F. in the shade, 105&deg; in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-133" id="Pg_2-133"></a>[<a href="./images/2-133.png">133</a>]</span>
sun&mdash;the insects not too troublesome; so that it
seemed to us a paradise on earth.</p>

<p>We had now before us a great expanse of 5,000 m.
of straight river to 345&deg; b.m., with two parallel ranges
of hills extending from west to east. The second range
was the higher of the two&mdash;some 600 ft., whereas the
first was only 200 ft. high.</p>

<p>What I took to be a great river coming from 75&deg; b.m.
(N.E.), 250 m. wide, joined the Arinos from the right
side; but I was puzzled whether this was not a mere
arm of the Arinos. In the quick survey I was making,
and with the many things which occupied my mind
at every moment, the river being moreover so wide, it
was impossible, single-handed, to survey everything
carefully on every side. Therefore this may have
been a mere arm of the Arinos which I mistook for a
tributary. It was not possible for me to deviate from
my course every moment to go and ascertain problematic
details, but it will be quite easy for subsequent
travellers to clear up this point now that attention
has been drawn to it.</p>

<p>An island, 1,000 m. long&mdash;Olivia Island&mdash;was found
at the point where the main arm of the river flowed
in a direction of 345&deg; b.m., and where to the north-west,
north, and north-east, three hill ranges were before us&mdash;one
300 ft. high, extending from south-west to north-east
on the left side of the river; another thickly
wooded hill from west to east, also 300 ft. high; and
yet another one, the highest of all, behind it from
S.S.W. to N.N.E., on the right bank. The river was
350 m. wide, and its water almost stagnant.</p>

<p>Another barrier of rock held up the stream. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-134" id="Pg_2-134"></a>[<a href="./images/2-134.png">134</a>]</span>
came to an island 800 m. long, 300 m. wide&mdash;Sabrina
Island&mdash;on the left side of the stream, which showed
a beautiful spit of white sand at its southern end.</p>

<p>I halted on the bank where the island began in order
to take observations for latitude and longitude, and as
the day was a very clear one I took forty-eight consecutive
sights of the sun with the sextant. Lat. 10&deg; 35&#8242;&middot;1 S.;
long. 58&deg; 12&#8242; W. While I was busy observing the sun
I thought I heard curious noises in the forest just
behind me. The dogs all of a sudden jumped up,
barking furiously, and I heard the sounds of what
seemed an escaping person dashing away through the
thick growth near the stream. My men were greatly
excited, saying it was an Indian who had come quite
close to me, and was about to shoot an arrow while I
was busy with my sextant and chronometers. All
through lunch they sat with their loaded rifles next to
them, in case we might be attacked.</p>

<p>The river now flowed in a straight line for 5,000 m.
in a north-westerly direction. Half-way along was a
large triangular island&mdash;Pandora Island; then farther
on the left another island, 2,000 m. long&mdash;Sibyl Island.</p>

<p>The river was of extraordinary beauty in that
region. The tall range of hills to the north-west of
us showed beautiful cobalt-blue tones against the
whitish and grey sky; while the dark green foliage of
the trees and the yellow blooms of the <i>Oleo pardo</i> trees
visible here and there, the immaculate white sandy
beach along the water line, together with the brilliantly
red and yellow rocks which stood out of the crystalline
emerald water, formed indeed a beautiful scene for
the painter's brush.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-135" id="Pg_2-135"></a>[<a href="./images/2-135.png">135</a>]</span>
It did not do to be poetically inclined when
travelling on the Arinos. I had hardly time to realize
how beautiful that scene was when we found ourselves
confronted by another big barrier of rocks, through
which we went over a swift <i>corrideira</i>.</p>

<p>A basin was formed, 900 m. wide, with an extensive
island of rock on the right side of it. Then we suddenly
came to a terrible-looking rapid at an incline so steep
that I foresaw trouble in store for us. There was no
way of stopping anywhere, as the current was swiftly
taking us down.</p>

<p>"We are lost!" shouted one man. "Jesus Maria
Santissima!"</p>

<p>"Paddle away! paddle away, for Heaven's sake!"
I shouted, as I knew that speed alone could save us
from disaster.</p>

<p>Down went the canoe at an angle of 45&deg; in the
foaming and twisting waters of the rapid. Where the
water curled right over itself the heavy canoe was
lifted up in the air like a feather, and as I turned round
to shout to Alcides to steer straight ahead I saw his
expanded eyes looking in terror at the terrific whirlpool
which was facing us at the bottom of the rapid.</p>

<p>"No! no!" cried Alcides.</p>

<p>"Straight&mdash;straight! For God's sake, straight!"
shouted I; and as I saw the canoe swerve to the right I
again shouted to Alcides to steer straight in order to
avoid the dangerous part of the whirlpool.</p>

<p>Alcides would not steer straight, but steered us
instead on the right for the very centre of the whirlpool.
No sooner did the prow of the canoe enter the
circle of the rotating water, which formed a deep con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-136" id="Pg_2-136"></a>[<a href="./images/2-136.png">136</a>]</span>cave
hollow 70 or 80 m. in diameter, than, dipping her
nose in the water, she was flung right up into the air,
revolving on herself. Baggage and men all tumbled
over, two men being thrown with terrific force clean
out of the canoe. A lot of baggage disappeared into
the whirlpool. The canoe, although filled with water,
righted herself and spun round helplessly at an alarming
speed. The impact had been so violent that the
men, in tumbling over, had lost all the paddles except
one.</p>

<p>We heard the cries of the two men in the water,
and I saw them struggle in order to keep themselves
afloat. I gave a sigh of relief that the two men&mdash;already
a long distance from us&mdash;were, by a great
stroke of luck, the only two who could swim. I urged
them to have courage and we would come to their
rescue, although for a moment I could not think how
we should do it, as we had only one paddle left and
the steering gear had got torn away from its socket,
although Alcides with great courage had managed to
save it. I ordered my men to paddle with their hands
and with the large oar which was used for steering.
We were tossed about in a terrific manner, the men and
canoe going round and round the whirlpool in an
absolutely helpless fashion.</p>

<p class="fsc">Author's Men shooting a Crocodile.</p>
<hr />
<p>What distressed me more than anything was when I
saw the two men getting nearer and nearer the centre,
although they made a desperate struggle to swim away
from it. In our effort to get to them by using the
steering oar, the canoe, for some reason or other, swung
round upon herself two or three times, and I saw with
gladness the men gradually getting nearer. It was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-137" id="Pg_2-137"></a>[<a href="./images/2-137.png">137</a>]</span>
moment of joy when I saw Antonio, who was a powerful
swimmer, within only a few feet of the canoe.
His face was ghastly, with an expression of terror
upon it. He was quite exhausted, and was shouting
pitifully for help. The man X was a few yards farther
off.</p>

<p>The canoe suddenly swung round, going right
against Antonio, who grasped the side of the boat and
proceeded in such haste to climb on board that he
came within an ace of capsizing her. A few moments
later we were alongside of X, but he was so exhausted
that he had not the strength to climb up. We seized
him and with great difficulty lifted him inside the
canoe.</p>

<p>We continued to go round and round the vortex
in a helpless fashion, endeavouring with the steering
oar to get out of that perilous position. As I gazed
around I saw my camp bed and bedding, which were
enclosed in a water-tight canvas bag, still floating close
to the centre of the whirlpool. Alas! a moment later
they were sucked down. Most of our cooking utensils
which were loose in the canoe had been washed overboard.
Two of our casseroles were floating gracefully
in a circle round the whirlpool.</p>

<p>It is curious how people's mentality will work on
such occasions. After we had been some minutes endeavouring
to get away from the centre of the whirlpool,
one of my men, who had recovered from the fright,
saw the cooking pans, which were about to disappear.
His first impulse was to shout that we must go and get
them!</p>

<p>It was with some relief that we were able to extri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-138" id="Pg_2-138"></a>[<a href="./images/2-138.png">138</a>]</span>cate
ourselves, and eventually reached the outer edge
of the whirlpool, where the water changed direction,
and the canoe was swung violently, entering a patch
of comparatively placid water. Paddling with our
hands we slowly reached the bank, and nearly an hour
later&mdash;it having taken us all that time to go about
150 m.&mdash;we baled the water out of the canoe and proceeded
to examine the amount of our loss.</p>

<p>Nearly all the cooking utensils, as I have said, had
disappeared; two boxes of tinned provisions had gone
overboard and were lost for ever; a bag of flour and a
bag of rice had vanished in those terrible waters; a
package containing a great part of my clothes had also
gone for ever, as well as some of the clothing of my
men. What was worse than all for me, my camp-bed
and all my bedding were lost, which would compel me
in the future to sleep either on the ground&mdash;which was
practically impossible in that region owing to the
number of ants and other insects&mdash;or else do as I did,
sleep on four wooden packing-boxes, which I placed in
a line. They made a most uneven and hard bed,
as I had, of course, no mattress and no covering of
any kind. A despatch-box, with some money, a lot
of important official letters and other documents, were
lost, and also my mercurial artificial horizon and one of
my chronometers. A number of other things of less importance
were also gone and quite beyond recovery.</p>

<p>We worked hard all that afternoon and the greater
part of the night in shaping new paddles out of trees
we had cut down with the axes, which were fortunately
not lost. The new paddles were even more primitive
and clumsy than those we had before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-139" id="Pg_2-139"></a>[<a href="./images/2-139.png">139</a>]</span>
We dried what remained of our baggage in the sun
during the afternoon. The beautiful sandy beach on
which we had landed looked very gay with all the
articles I had spread out from some of my trunks, including
a dress-suit which I hung on a young palm,
and other such articles, which looked rather incongruous
in that particular region. All the white linen clothes I
possessed had gone, and there only remained some
good serge clothes which I had kept for my arrival in
civilized places again. My water-tight boxes had been
knocked about so much that they had got injured and
let in a good deal of moisture.</p>

<p>One of my valuable cameras was badly damaged
in the accident, and one of my sextants was soaked to
such an extent that it took me the best part of two
hours to clean it all up again. I saved the negatives
which were in the damaged camera by developing them
at once during the night while they were still wet.</p>

<p>My men were greatly excited over the accident,
especially the two who had fallen into the water. In
a way I was glad it had happened, as I was in hopes it
might be a good lesson to them and they might be a
little more careful in the future. Had Alcides obeyed
my orders we should have gone through safely. I
pointed that out to him, but it was no use; even then
he maintained that in order to be safe you must steer
right into the whirlpool and not out of it&mdash;which really
made me begin to feel rather nervous, as I fully expected,
as we went along, to find worse rapids than
those we had negotiated so far, since we still had to
get down from 1,000 ft. or so to the sea level.</p>

<p>We halted for the remainder of the day. I spent a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-140" id="Pg_2-140"></a>[<a href="./images/2-140.png">140</a>]</span>
miserable night sleeping on the packing-boxes, now that
my bed had gone for ever. I did not deserve that bit
of ill-luck, for indeed my camp-bed was the only thing
I possessed which gave me a little comfort. After
working hard all day and the greater part of the night,
a few hours spent lying down flat on the stretched
canvas of the bed were most enjoyable; although never,
throughout the entire journey, was I able to sleep
soundly, as I always had to be on the alert, never
knowing what might happen.</p>

<hr />
<p>The night of July 22nd was fairly cool, the minimum
temperature being 58&deg; F. When we proceeded on our
journey in the morning we passed an island 1,500 m.
long&mdash;Arabella Island. The river was now flowing due
west. Again we came upon rocks in the centre and
upon the right side of the river, with a strong <i>corrideira</i>
and with dangerous submerged rocks close to the
surface. There was an islet 150 m. long on the right
side in a basin 500 m. broad. A hill 100 ft. high stood
on the left side of the stream, while a hill range 300 ft.
high was now visible to the W.N.W.</p>

<p>We had little time to admire the beautiful scenery,
for we soon found ourselves upon another great barrier
with a terrible-looking rapid. I asked my men if they
preferred to shoot it, as the exertion of loading and
unloading the canoe was certainly heavy.</p>

<p>"No, no, no, no!" they all cried in a chorus.</p>

<p>We therefore unloaded the canoe, and with considerable
trouble and waste of time we led her down
the rapid by means of ropes. Even led in that fashion
with the greatest care, the canoe was entirely filled
with water.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-141" id="Pg_2-141"></a>[<a href="./images/2-141.png">141</a>]</span>
Islets of rock of considerable beauty rose from the
river on the right-hand side. As we got a little way
farther, slightly more to the north-west, another hill
range, perhaps a little higher than the one we had
already observed, began to disclose itself to the north-west,
on the right side of the river. As we advanced
I further ascertained that the first range extended in
a general direction from south-west to north-east.
The river had actually eroded its way through this
range. Strong rapids were again met with at that
point, the channel being strewn with innumerable
sharp-edged rocks, most unpleasant if you were to
come in contact with them.</p>

<p>A small islet with a picturesque spur of rock on the
north side was here seen; then a larger island, 300 m.
long&mdash;Evelina Island&mdash;also on the left side. The river
flowed for 3,000 m. in a N.N.W. direction, and at the
end of that distance a rectangular island, 200 m. long
and 80 m. wide&mdash;Eileen Island&mdash;embellished it. Like
most of the islands in that particular portion of the
river it had a beautiful spur of rock on its eastern side,
preceded by a little islet also of rock. We passed to
the left of this island. It was separated by a channel
80 m. wide from another narrow island, 200 m. to the
west of it&mdash;Diana Island.</p>

<p>Just before getting to a third range extending from
south-west to north-east, and, like the other two, about
300 ft. high, we came upon a long barrier of rock
spreading diagonally for about 1,000 m. from south-west
to north-east. A long narrow island (200 m. long)&mdash;Bertha
Island&mdash;began from that point close to the
right bank, and another had been separated by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-142" id="Pg_2-142"></a>[<a href="./images/2-142.png">142</a>]</span>
water from the bank itself. A tributary 2 m. wide was
observed on the left side. We kept close to the left
bank and passed on our right an island 300 m. long&mdash;Sophia
Island.</p>

<p>So numerous were the islands following one another
that I was beginning to have great difficulty in supplying
sufficient names for them all.</p>

<p>More rapids were reached, and were of terrific force&mdash;especially
in the centre of the river. It took me some
little time to find a suitable passage, but at last I found
a channel 25 m. wide through which I got the canoe
among innumerable rocks. We went over a great <i>filare</i>&mdash;by
which word the Italians cleverly define an extensive
alignment in the stratum&mdash;of rock of extreme hardness
which had evidently been fractured in some violent
commotion of the earth, and had left sharp edges which
cut just like knives close to the surface of the water.
This rocky obstacle extended as usual from south-east
to north-west.</p>

<p>A tiny streamlet entered the river on the left not
far from the hill range on that same side. The trees
in that particular region had a most peculiar appearance:
their high, perfectly straight stems, quite free
from branches or leaves up to their very summit,
looked like so many columns, mostly of a whitish
colour. Many, however, were encircled, others absolutely
smothered with creepers. The scenery was really
beautiful; it was like travelling through fairyland.</p>

<p>In the centre of the basin 400 m. wide to which we
next came was an island, 80 m. in diameter&mdash;Gingillo
Island&mdash;and to the south-west of it a small islet with
an extensive beach and accumulation of rocks in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-143" id="Pg_2-143"></a>[<a href="./images/2-143.png">143</a>]</span>
northerly direction. On the southern side of the
river a sand beach, interspersed with rocks, spread
almost across, as far as the latter island.</p>

<p>I took 55 astronomical sights in order to get the
exact latitude and longitude (lat. 10&deg; 30&#8242;&middot;7 S.; long.
58&deg; 19&#8242; W.), and to check the time of the second chronometer,
which still remained in my possession. We
had made poor progress that day as far as the distance
went&mdash;only 17 kil. 100 m.</p>

<p>We had come to some nasty rapids, which at first
looked quite impassable by water, some of the waves
shooting up so high in the air as to make it out of the
question for any canoe to go through.</p>

<p>There was another extensive <i>filare</i> of rock, so
beautifully polished that it looked almost as if it had
been varnished over. It was evidently an ancient flow
of lava, with great holes in it here and there. The
flow spread from south-west to north-east, was of a
brilliant shining yellow, and most beautiful to look at.</p>

<p>I had to make my camp on the rocks near this
rapid, where we unloaded the canoe in order to take
her down by means of ropes by the eastern channel&mdash;very
narrow and very unpleasant, but it was the only
one possible. It was all we could do to hold the canoe
as she tobogganed down the incline, and we had some
nasty falls on the slippery rock trying to hold her.</p>

<p>We had a dangerous bit of work to do the moment
we had descended the rapid, for we had then to navigate
the canoe right across the basin, where whirlpools of
some magnitude were formed, directly over a waterfall
of some height and pouring down great volumes of
water with a terrific roar on the north-east side of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-144" id="Pg_2-144"></a>[<a href="./images/2-144.png">144</a>]</span>
basin; then along the really terrifying rapid on the
south-west side. It was necessary to do that, as I had
observed that it was only on the opposite side of the
river that we could possibly take the canoe down, and
no other course was open to us than to go across that
dangerous spot.</p>

<p>We had to be smart about it, or we certainly should
have perished. My men behaved splendidly. We had
reloaded the canoe. The quarter of an hour or so
which it took us to cross that basin was somewhat
exciting, as we struggled through the various whirlpools,
the current all the time dragging us closer and
closer to the waterfall, while my men were paddling
with all their might and Alcides was steering right
against the current in order to prevent the fatal
leap.</p>

<p>I urged the men on, and they paddled and paddled
away, their eyes fixed on the fall which was by that
time only a few metres away from us. They were
exhausted in the frantic effort, and their paddles seemed
to have no effect in propelling the canoe. The men,
who were always talkative, were now silent; only the
man X exclaimed, as we were only eight or ten metres
from the fall: "Good-bye, father and mother! I
shall never see you again!" The other men gave a
ghastly grin.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Cataract in the Arinos River.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Go on! Row! row!&mdash;For God's sake row!"
I shouted to them, as I saw they had given themselves
up for lost. "Row!" I shouted once more; and as
if the strength had suddenly come back to them they
made a frantic effort. The canoe went a little faster
for a minute or two&mdash;just enough for us to clear the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-145" id="Pg_2-145"></a>[<a href="./images/2-145.png">145</a>]</span>
waterfall and to drift alongside some rocks which stood
in the centre of the stream. We were saved.</p>

<p>My men were so exhausted that we had to rest
there for some time before we could proceed to cross
the dreadful rapid down the other portion of the
barrier.</p>

<p>I was glad we had had that experience, because it
showed me that after all it was possible to make
brave men of men who were absolutely pusillanimous
before. When I mentioned that we still had to go
over the other dangerous part, they said, much to my
delight:</p>

<p>"We are Brazilians&mdash;we are afraid of nothing!
We will come with you." And what is more, they did.</p>

<p>They smoked a few cigarettes. I had always
supplied them with ample tobacco in order to keep
them in a good temper. Then when I gave the order
to start they jumped gaily into the canoe, shouting
again:</p>

<p>"We are Brazilians! We are afraid of nothing!"</p>

<p>So we began negotiating the second portion of
that nasty crossing. There is nothing I admire more
than courage. My men went up in my estimation that
day at least a hundred per cent.</p>

<p>The second part of our crossing was just as dangerous
as the first part&mdash;perhaps more so. The men, however,
behaved splendidly, and rowed with such vigour
that we got through safely and quickly above the most
difficult portion, and eventually landed upon a mass
of rocks on the opposite side of the stream.</p>

<p>There we had a busy time, as we had once more to
unload the canoe, cut a way through the forest in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-146" id="Pg_2-146"></a>[<a href="./images/2-146.png">146</a>]</span>
order to convey the baggage overland to a spot about
half a mile farther down stream; then we had to come
back to take the canoe by means of ropes down the
rapid itself.</p>

<p>It was necessary for one of us to be inside the
canoe in order to steer her while being led down.
Alcides, who was indeed an extraordinarily brave man,
would not hand over his job to anybody else, and
insisted on being allowed to steer the canoe. It was
with great reluctance that I allowed him, as he could
not swim. When we proceeded to let the canoe down
by the small western channel, the foaming waters
and high waves rolling back upon themselves with
great force were most troublesome to negotiate. The
canoe was repeatedly lifted right out of the water,
and gave us holding the ropes such violent jerks
that we were flung in all directions. When I got up
again, still holding on to the rope, Alcides had disappeared.
He had been pitched clean out of the canoe.
Fortunately, a moment later I saw that he was clinging
to the steering gear, which we had made extra fast
in order that it might stand the great strain.</p>

<p>We managed to pull the canoe and Alcides close to
the rocks. Eventually we all had to go into the
water up to our necks and lead the canoe by hand with
the greatest care in the swift current for the remaining
distance. Once or twice we were nearly overpowered
by the current, and we were glad when, nearly two
hours later, our job was finished, and, absolutely exhausted,
we made camp for the night on the rocks.</p>

<p>The men were so excited that during the entire
night they sat up commenting on the experience of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-147" id="Pg_2-147"></a>[<a href="./images/2-147.png">147</a>]</span>
the day. Their remarks were quite amusing, especially
their imitations of the rush of the water, the bumping
of the canoe, and Alcides' sudden disappearance and
narrow escape from drowning.</p>

<p>The waterfall and rapids spread across the river
at that spot for some 650 m. During the night of
July 24th the thermometer showed a minimum temperature
of 62&deg; F.</p>

<p>I noticed a small streamlet 1 m. wide on the left
bank, and to the W.S.W. a conical hill rising over a
gently sloping undulating range 350 ft. above the river
level&mdash;that is to say, about 1,400 ft. above the sea
level.</p>

<p>A strong wind sprang up, which caught us sideways
and produced such high waves breaking over the
canoe, and so severe a motion, that my men became
ill. We had to stop, until the wind abated, on a
small charming island. As we were approaching the
island Alcides sent us right over a rock which was
sticking some 2 ft. above water. The bottom of the
canoe was so scraped in the violent collision that a
good deal of the stuffing with which we had filled the
longitudinal crack was torn off, and she quickly filled
with water. When we halted more garments had to be
destroyed in order to fill up the aperture to the best of
our ability.</p>

<p>When the storm was over we continued our journey,
going over some rapids in quite a novel way. The
men were quarrelling among themselves and had stopped
paddling, the paddles being waved in the air in a
threatening way as they spoke violently to one another.
Alcides had also left the steering gear, and in his fury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-148" id="Pg_2-148"></a>[<a href="./images/2-148.png">148</a>]</span>
against the other men had seized his rifle in order to
give force to his words. We were approaching the
rapid. I advised them to continue their quarrel after
we had gone through, but they would not listen to me.
The prow of the canoe, just as we were about to enter
the rapid, was caught in a rock, and the canoe swung
right round, so that we shot the rapid floating down
stern first. We shipped a lot of water, the refreshing
bath somewhat cooling the excitement of my men, who,
realizing the danger when we entered the whirlpool,
took to paddling again.</p>

<p>I discovered from their conversation during the
night that my men were imbued with the idea that I
had a guardian angel attending my person, and that no
matter what happened while they were with me they
would have no mishap.</p>

<p>The river gradually turned northwards again. I
noticed on the right side a hill-range 350 ft. high, extending
from south-west to north-east.</p>

<p>The wind came up again, tossing the canoe about
considerably. My men once more became seasick
owing to the rolling. The new paddles we had made
from fresh wood after our accident in the rapids did
not prove much of a success, the wood splitting badly.
We had to keep the various pieces together by tying
them with string. I could not help laughing when I
looked at my men paddling. One paddle had a quadrangular
blade; another formed an elongated oval;
a third had originally been circular but was then
reduced to the shape of a half-moon, the other half
having been washed away.</p>

<hr />
<p>For 4,000 m. the river had flowed due west, then it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-149" id="Pg_2-149"></a>[<a href="./images/2-149.png">149</a>]</span>
turned to 310&deg; b.m. Two large islands in succession&mdash;one
400 m. long and 350 m. wide&mdash;Pericles Island; the
second of an equal width to the first, and 700 m. long&mdash;Aspasia
Island&mdash;were seen.</p>

<p>A high wind from the north-east and east continued
the entire day, and broke into occasional severe gusts
that were most troublesome to us. Heavy rain-clouds
hung over our heads. My men felt cold and shivery
and quite miserable in the choppy waters, which made
them extremely ill. Their faces were green and yellow,
their eyes had a pitiful expression in them. They
looked as if they were all being led to execution. The
temperature of the atmosphere was only 75&deg; F.</p>

<p>Shortly before sunset, after a beautiful stretch of
river of 4,000 m. to 335&deg; b.m. (N.N.W.), followed by
one of 4,000 m. 5&deg; farther to the north, we came to an
immense basin&mdash;a regular lake&mdash;4,000 m. long, 1,500 m.
wide, with two lovely islands in its northerly part.
It was there that the great River Juruena, coming
from the south-west, joined the Arinos. We had the
greatest difficulty in crossing the big, deep lake,
because of the high wind which was blowing at the
time. The waves were high and caught us on one
side; the rolling was so heavy that on many occasions
we shipped a great deal of water and nearly capsized.
When we got into the centre of the lake the wind
increased in fury. My men were very ill and much
scared&mdash;for we had a great expanse of water on all
sides and we could not bale the water out of the canoe
fast enough, so quickly was she filling. I urged on the
men all the time and took an extra paddle myself to
encourage them. We made slow progress, the men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-150" id="Pg_2-150"></a>[<a href="./images/2-150.png">150</a>]</span>
suffering greatly. I had to wait for their convenience
every few moments when they were badly indisposed.</p>

<p>We tossed about for the best part of two hours,
until at last we reached the opposite side of the lake.
In a hurry to land, Alcides threw the canoe over
some rocks on which the water was breaking with fury.
However, the water was shallow at that point. We
jumped out, and eventually, trembling with cold, we
beached the canoe on a most beautiful island, where
we made our camp for the night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> spot where the two great rivers met was most
impressive, especially from the island on which we
stood, directly opposite the entrance of the two streams.
The immense lake was spread before us, and beyond
were the two great rivers meeting at an angle. Great
walls of verdant forest lined all the banks and islands
before us. Curiously enough, both in the Arinos and
in the Juruena two long narrow islands appeared
parallel to the banks of each stream. The islands resembled
each other in size. The Juruena had two
islands near its mouth, one narrow and long, the
other in the shape of a quadrangle. The Arinos
also showed a long and narrow island at its mouth,
and another ending in a point.</p>

<p>It was my intention to take soundings right across
the mouth of the Arinos and also across the mouth of
the Juruena, but unluckily, owing to the strong
easterly wind which prevailed that day, it was quite
impossible for me to attempt such a task at the mouth
of the Arinos, and equally impossible was it to proceed
back across the lake to the mouth of the Juruena<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-152" id="Pg_2-152"></a>[<a href="./images/2-152.png">152</a>]</span>
to measure the volume of water which came out of
that river. Without any attempt at mathematical
accuracy I should say that the two rivers carried an
almost equal volume of water.</p>

<p>Where we landed there were two separate islands,
one of which I named after my sister&mdash;the Elfrida
Landor Island; the other one, next to it, I named
Francesco Island. The Elfrida Landor Island&mdash;really
most beautiful to look at&mdash;was 800 m. long; Francesco
Island was 1,200 m. in length but not quite so broad.</p>

<p>There was a most picturesque channel 200 m. wide,
with marvellous rocks forming a barrier across it, on
the right side of the river, between Francesco Island
and the right bank. The main part of the stream,
however, flowed in a much larger channel between the
left bank and Elfrida Landor Island.</p>

<p>The joint Arinos-Juruena River had now a total
width of 500 m., and flowed in a direction of 15&deg; bearings
magnetic. I took accurate observations with the
hypsometrical apparatus in order to determine the
exact elevation of that important spot: water boiled
at the junction of the Juruena and Arinos at 210&deg;&middot;4&frac34;,
while the temperature of the air was 70&deg; F.; in other
words the elevation of the place was 987 ft. above the
sea level.</p>

<p class="fsc">Author's Canoe going down a Cataract.</p>
<hr />
<p>I also took observations there for latitude and
longitude. Lat. 10&deg; 21&#8242;&middot;7 S.; long. 58&deg; 35&#8242; W. The
Juruena entered the lake from bearings magnetic
250&deg; (W.S.W.), the Arinos from bearings magnetic
100&deg; (E.S.E.). The minimum temperature during the
night on Elfrida Island was 57&deg; F. My men suffered
a great deal from the cold, as they had got badly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-153" id="Pg_2-153"></a>[<a href="./images/2-153.png">153</a>]</span>
chilled with the wet and the high wind during the day.
Most of them complained of severe rheumatic pains
and violent toothache. They could not understand
why I did not have any pains of any kind&mdash;and to tell
the truth, neither could I, after all we had gone through
of late.</p>

<p>When we left Elfrida Landor Island on July 25th
we had a beautiful stretch of river 4,000 m. long in a
straight line, but with a good many rocks strewn in
the channel. The men paddled unwillingly, as they
said they were aching all over; but the current was
strong and we were going along fairly quickly. My
men said that we must now have come to the end
of all the rapids. I did not care to disillusion them,
although I suspected that we still had hard days
in store. We had not proceeded very far when a
rumbling noise warned us that we were approaching
danger. There was a rapid on the east side of the
river, but it left a fairly easy passage on the west. A
little farther, however, we came to a very bad rapid,
and had to unload the canoe, which we were obliged
to let down carefully with ropes. My men, who felt
feverish and irritable, owing to our previous day's
experience, were greatly upset at this new obstacle
facing us.</p>

<p>The river was 500 m. wide at this part. The rocks
on which we trod when we took the canoe down were
so sharp that they cut our feet. It was not possible
to wear shoes, as when we had them on we slipped
on the rock and had no hold upon the ropes. My men,
in their state of weakness, had not sufficient strength
to hold the canoe, and the moment she entered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-154" id="Pg_2-154"></a>[<a href="./images/2-154.png">154</a>]</span>
swift current she escaped, dragging one man into the
rapid. I jumped into the water after him, and just
managed to grab him before he was swept away altogether
in the terrific current. We were all drenched,
and as the wind blew with great violence that day,
and there was no sun to warm us up, we felt the
cold very much.</p>

<p>The canoe was thrown mercilessly now against one
rock, then against another; but, as luck would have it,
after she had made several pirouettes, we, running all
the time with our bleeding feet on the sharp rocks along
the bank, were eventually able to recapture her at the
end of the rapid. Then came the job of going back
to fetch all the baggage and bring it down, baling the
water out of the canoe, and starting off once more.</p>

<p>My men were tired; they said they could stand the
work no more, and they wanted to remain there and
die. It took much persuasion to make them come on.
I succeeded principally by giving them a good example,
carrying down most of the loads that day myself from
the upper end of the rapid to the lower&mdash;a distance of
several hundred metres. I was getting tired, too, of
carrying the heavy loads, but I never let my men see
it; that would have been fatal.</p>

<p>The river was divided into two channels by a group
of islands which must at one time have been one great
triangular one, subsequently worn by parallel and
transverse channels into seven islands. The first,
most southerly, was 300 m. broad, 150 m. long,
and of a triangular shape. The three immediately
behind this, and of irregular shapes, had an average
length of some 700 m.; whereas the last group of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-155" id="Pg_2-155"></a>[<a href="./images/2-155.png">155</a>]</span>
three, all of elongated shapes, had a length of
300 m. each. I was getting to the end of the list of
names for all those islands, and I was at a loss to find
seven names all of a sudden, so I called the group the
Seven Sisters Islands. At the end of the group the
river narrowed to 400 m. in width between a long
island to the west and the right bank, and flowed due
north for 12,000 m. in a direct line&mdash;indeed a most
beautiful sight. Fifteen hundred metres down that
distance a great barrier of columnar or cylindrical rocks
stuck out of the water from W.S.W. to E.N.E. North
of those rocks on the left side, upon the island, not less
than 5,000 m. long&mdash;Lunghissima Island&mdash;was a beautiful
yellow sand beach 200 m. long, which formed a
separate islet with trees upon its northerly half. Numerous
rocks obstructed the east side (right) of the river.</p>

<p>Farther on, another lovely sandy islet 100 m. long
had formed behind a number of rocks, and was of a
clean, beautiful yellowish white, with a few shrubs and
trees growing upon it. All those sand beaches were
extremely interesting to me. I invariably landed
upon them. I had made a wonderful collection of all
the minute plants and delightful miniature flowers
which grew upon these beaches&mdash;an immense variety,
indeed, but of such small dimensions and of such
delicate tints that it required sometimes a great strain
of eyesight to see them at all. Some were really most
beautiful. I spent a good deal of time and patience
in collecting, pressing, and classifying those dainty
little sand-plants, and I was beginning to flatter
myself that I had formed a complete collection.</p>

<p>At the spot where Lunghissima Island came to an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-156" id="Pg_2-156"></a>[<a href="./images/2-156.png">156</a>]</span>
end a large triangular island was to be seen on the left
of us. A great barrier of rocks stretched across the
stream, a prominent cluster of picturesque boulders
forming a powerful spur which cut the current at the
southern part of the triangle of land.</p>

<p>Although the thermometer marked 93&deg; in the sun
my men complained of the intense cold, partly because
they all had fever, partly also because the wind was
extremely strong that day and caused waves of some
size in the stream, which dashed against the canoe and
splashed us all over. Again my men were seasick that
day, and got furious with me as I could not help laughing
at their plight.</p>

<p>With a slight deviation of 20&deg; to the west came
another stretch of 4,000 m. in a straight line. A two-humped
range of hills now loomed before us to the
north-west. We had gone along the side of another
elongated island 8,000 metres in length&mdash;Yolanda
Island. When we came to the end of this great island,
two other islands parallel to each other were disclosed
to the west of us, one 1,000 m. long&mdash;Carmela Island&mdash;the
other 600 m.&mdash;Stella Island. The first had a
pretty island 300 m. long&mdash;Hilda Island&mdash;next to it
on the east side. We halted at the end of Yolanda
Island and there took observations for latitude and
longitude, thirty-one consecutive sights of the sun
being taken. Lat. 10&deg; 13&#8242;&middot;3 S; long. 58&deg; 35&#8242; W.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Immense Waves encountered by Author in emerging from the Channel in the Rapid of the Inferno.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(The canoe with its occupants shot up vertically in the air.)</p>
<hr />
<p>When we resumed our journey four more islets were
visible and a barrier of rock from north-west to south-east
again stretching right across the stream. Just
beyond lay Romola Island, 1,200 m. long and equally
broad. At the end of the island we found a channel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-157" id="Pg_2-157"></a>[<a href="./images/2-157.png">157</a>]</span>
100 m. wide, separating it from two neighbours on the
east; in fact, much to my dismay, we found ourselves
in a regular maze of islands and rocks, and my time
was fully employed keeping an account of and measuring
them.</p>

<p>A crescent-shaped island&mdash;Urania Island&mdash;1,000 m.
in length, with most wonderful vegetation upon it, was
now on our left. That region was extraordinarily rich
in rubber. The channel which we had followed was
strewn all over with rocks. Another island, 400 m.
long&mdash;Caterina Island&mdash;followed. The current in the
Arinos-Juruena River had a speed of 80 m. a minute.
The river in places where no islands lay had a width
of 200 m. The water was most beautifully clear, of
a lovely emerald green, with a wonderful white sand
bottom clearly visible although the river had considerable
depth in many places. Yet another island, 600 m.
long&mdash;Una Island&mdash;came in sight to the right of us;
then another between two companions, forming almost
a circle round the central isle. The river now formed a
basin not less than 800 m. wide with innumerable rocks
at the entrance. We went on kilometre after kilometre,
spending our time in avoiding unpleasant rocks, when
again we came first to fairly strong rapids, then to an
extremely dangerous rapid, which we shot, as we were
carried away into it before we had time to realize where
we were. We had the greatest difficulty in extricating
ourselves from the many terrifying whirlpools at
the end of the rapid, in a great basin 900 m. wide. We
found a most beautiful halting place on a natural terrace
of volcanic rock some 20 ft. above the river, with
a dome of rock in the centre.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-158" id="Pg_2-158"></a>[<a href="./images/2-158.png">158</a>]</span>
I met signs of Indians close to the river. Evidently
a tribe had once halted there, but apparently many
years before our arrival. I discovered their fireplaces,
several carved pieces of wood, and some fragments
of rudimentary pottery in the neighbourhood of this
picturesque spot. In exploring round the place I
also found some almost entirely obliterated indications
of several ancient trails which had been made by the
Indians in the forest.</p>

<p>Looking toward bearings magnetic 340&deg;, and also
in the opposite direction to the south, most gorgeous
river scenes were before us. This was by far the
most beautiful spot I had come across on the river so
far. I therefore named the huge island on which I
stood George Rex Island. I gave Alcides orders to
carve the name on a tree, but as he was an anarchist
he refused to do it, excusing himself by saying that
he had injured his hand.</p>

<p>At that camp we caught over 400 lb. of fish in
less than half an hour&mdash;three <i>jahus</i> among the number,
each weighing over 40 lb. Then we also captured
two <i>cachorra</i> or dog fish, which possessed vicious-looking
molars of great length, not unlike those of a
big dog. Each of these fish weighed over 30 lb.
Then we got eight <i>trahiras</i>, some 20 lb. each in weight.
With the little salt which remained we preserved some
of the fish, as we were now getting very short of food.
However, we had excellent meals most of the time on
the river, frying the fish with fat which we extracted
from the fish itself.</p>

<p>During the night of July 26th we had a minimum
temperature of 55&deg; F., but as we had had plenty to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-159" id="Pg_2-159"></a>[<a href="./images/2-159.png">159</a>]</span>
eat the previous evening&mdash;in fact, too much&mdash;we did
not feel the cold quite so severely.</p>

<p><i>Ariranhas</i> in large families were plentiful near that
spot, and came close several times, grinding their
teeth at us, especially when we were slaughtering the
fish on the bank. We kept watch during the entire
night, as on that occasion they were truly vicious. Our
dogs, for a change, became quite sportive. One of
them, named Negrino, got furious with the <i>ariranhas</i>,
and, driven mad by their unmusical noises, actually
jumped into the stream to go to their attack. In a
moment he had quantities of <i>ariranhas</i> upon him, and
was bitten savagely, one ear being nearly torn off. He
endeavoured to beat a retreat, but by that time he
was in mid-stream and struggling for dear life against
his enemies. We put out in the canoe at once and
went to his rescue, eventually getting him on board in
an exhausted condition, and bleeding terribly all over.</p>

<p>We enjoyed a hearty breakfast of boiled and fried
fish before leaving camp at 9 o'clock in the morning.
We were sorry to leave the beautiful camp&mdash;the best
we had had since we had been on the River Arinos.
There were before us two great channels. The one
flowing east was the larger of the two, fully 400 m.
wide and 3,000 m. long in a straight line. As we were
paddling along we passed on our left a triangular island
the southern side of which was 2,000 m. long, the south-east
side 500 m.&mdash;Angela Island.</p>

<p>Where the river deviated to 30&deg; b.m. a perfectly
straight stretch of 8,000 m. was before us&mdash;a
most beautiful sight. Two parallel islands, only
50 m. wide, one 400 m. the other 300 m. long, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-160" id="Pg_2-160"></a>[<a href="./images/2-160.png">160</a>]</span>
on the right of us, in the part of the river where
George Rex Island, which was still to the right of
us, described a graceful semicircle. Fifteen hundred
metres farther down George Rex Island came to an
end with a beautiful spit of sand 200 m. long. Just
beyond, still on our right, another island, 400 m. long&mdash;Rosalinda
Island&mdash;was passed, also with a lovely spit
of sand 200 m. in extent. The river at this place had
a total width of 500 m. At a point 5,000 m. down the
straight stretch due east we came to three parallel
elongated islands, two of them 300 m. long, the third
1,000 m. in length, all three on the right of us as we
floated down. A barrier of rocks extended right across
the stream from north-west to south-east, at a spot
where on our left side, at b.m. 330&deg;, a hill range extended
northwards. With a slight deviation of 10&deg; eastward
(40&deg; b.m.) another beautiful stretch of 6,000 m. was
before us. More islands, more clusters of picturesque
rocks were passed. First came a group of two islands,
the larger 350 m. long&mdash;Vanessa Island; then a beautiful
clean sand-spit 150 m. long, almost in mid-stream,
preceded a group of three parallel islands&mdash;Philomela
Island, 400 m. long, Portia Island, 300 m. and Psyche
Island, 4,500 m. Beyond these were two more islands,
one triangular in shape in the centre of the stream&mdash;Rhea
Island&mdash;some 250 m. long, with a strong
<i>corrideira</i> at its north-easterly terminus.</p>

<p>A most gorgeous sand-bank of great length now

on the right side. Where the river turned again due<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-161" id="Pg_2-161"></a>[<a href="./images/2-161.png">161</a>]</span>
east for 3,000 m., another set of parallel islands with
a chain of hills beyond them on the right bank was
to be seen. The hill range extended from north-west
to south-east. All these ranges, with a backbone
of rock underneath, formed, as it were, the
ribs which held up the central plateau of Brazil.
We were now in a region of wonderful accumulations
of sand; nearly all the islands showed a sand-spit of
great length on the up-stream side. Great islands
occurred once more: Paulina Island, 2,500 m. long, on
our left; another, 200 m. long&mdash;Olivia Island&mdash;on our
right; and a third&mdash;Clara Island&mdash;just beyond it. A
long tail of rocks followed, and the channel was strewn
with dangerous rocks where the river had cut its way
through the range of hills.</p>

<p>What must have been formerly an immense island
which had become cut up into three was now on the
left of us as we followed the central channel in an
easterly direction. The first of these was comparatively
small; the next&mdash;Tristan Island&mdash;was 1,500 m.
long; the third&mdash;Isolda Island&mdash;1,000 m. long. All
were of extraordinary beauty. Rubber trees were to be
seen, but not in such great numbers as we had found
farther up the stream. Evidently the soil was somewhat
too rocky and not sufficiently moist for their
healthy growth.</p>

<p>From due east the river suddenly turned to due
north, diverted by the great rib of rock which had
formerly made part of the hill range we had now on
our right. We had a good deal of trouble here, as
difficult rapids were encountered, and sharp, cutting
rocks, collision with which would have been fatal for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-162" id="Pg_2-162"></a>[<a href="./images/2-162.png">162</a>]</span>
us. Our canoe, after the many bumps we had already
experienced, gave alarming signs that she might split
in two longitudinally at any moment. For 5,000 m.
the river flowed in a northerly direction. Great
domes of granite and immense boulders were scattered
near the left bank, and rocks of all sizes and shapes
emerged from the water all over the basin, which was
600 m. across. Another barrier of rock stretched
from north-east to south-east and formed a high drop
in the river. We had to unload the canoe once more
upon some rocks in mid-stream, then let her gently
down the step of foaming waters by ropes. We were
then in a magnificent basin 1,000 m. wide, with a great
cluster of impressive rocks on the right side, in front of
two enchantingly beautiful islands&mdash;Melisande Island,
400 m. long, Pelleas Island, 700 m. long&mdash;on the left.</p>

<p>Whenever I was gazing enraptured at the heavenly
scenery Alcides always managed to send the canoe on
to some rock, which quickly brought me back, not to
earth but to water. His principle in life was always
to do the worst thing and then you knew that nothing
worse could happen&mdash;a topsy-turvy philosophy for
which we all had to suffer. Emerging from the basin,
we had two channels before us, one to the N.N.E., the
other N.N.W. Gigantic palm trees such as we had
seen along the River Arinos were now to be seen all
along the banks of the river. We saw in the water
not far from us a large <i>sucuri&uacute;</i> snake (<i>Eunictes murinus</i>),
fully 6 in. in diameter. It peeped its head out of
the water to gaze curiously into our canoe, and caused
some excitement among my men.</p>

<p>Another immense barrier of rocks with most trouble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-163" id="Pg_2-163"></a>[<a href="./images/2-163.png">163</a>]</span>some
rapids extended from south-west to north-east
right across the stream. That seemed a great place for
snakes, especially in the narrow and tortuous channel
which we followed, between a great island&mdash;Victor
Emmanuel Island&mdash;and the left bank. We were going
along fairly gaily when I saw a huge snake&mdash;another
<i>sucuri&uacute;</i>&mdash;floating upon the water among the foliage and
branches of a fallen tree. The section of the body
which I could perceive measured fully 2&frac12; ft. in diameter,
and I must say that for one moment&mdash;we were
only about 20 ft. away from it&mdash;I was somewhat
surprised, as my quickly calculating mind constructed
in my imagination a snake at least 100 ft. long. My
men immediately took to their rifles, and were about
to open a fusillade, but I stopped them, not caring to
disturb the sleep of so gigantic a reptile. It was with
some relief that, as the canoe floated quietly a little
farther, I perceived the head of the snake resting
gracefully in a sound slumber upon a branch of the
tree out of the water. The head was of more normal
proportions. We landed a little distance away as
quietly as possible, my men trembling all over with
excitement and fear in case the reptile should wake
up. Then all together they opened a fusillade until a
bullet actually struck the snake and it wriggled about.
There was a stampede of all my men through the
foliage and plants which grew along the stream. The
snake was dead. When they had made quite sure that
life was extinct my men returned and pulled the snake
out of the water. Although the section we had seen
floating was so big, the rest of the body was not more
than 4 in. in diameter. The snake had eaten an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-164" id="Pg_2-164"></a>[<a href="./images/2-164.png">164</a>]</span>
entire <i>veado</i> (deer), and that was the cause of the great
swelling of the central part of its body. The shape of
the devoured animal could be seen plainly inside it.
The photograph of the reptile which I took is given
in one of the illustrations of this book. The light was
not good for photographic purposes, as it was late in
the afternoon and the snake, which after all was only
18 ft. 5 in. long, lay under the shadow of the foliage,
which made photography rather difficult. As I was
trying to get a second photograph my men proceeded
with their knives to open the snake and see what was
inside. The terrific odour which ensued when they
did so made us violently ill, causing desperate vomiting.
I have seen it stated, in some books which have been
published about South America, that snakes of incredible
length are believed to exist on that continent.
Undoubtedly the notion has been suggested by the fact
that inexperienced travellers have seen immensely
broad traces of snakes along the soft ground near rivers.
Measuring the diameter of those trails they came to
the conclusion that the snake was 80 to 100 ft. long,
and without taking further trouble to ascertain they
stated they had actually seen a snake of that length.
Whereas, as a matter of fact, as in the case I have
described, the immense diameter of the snake was
merely in the section which enclosed some big animal
which had been swallowed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> camped some hundred metres away from the spot
where we had killed the <i>sucuri&uacute;</i>. It was getting late.
My men did not sleep a wink the whole night, as they
thought perhaps the mate of the snake might come
and pay us a visit. We had a lively time the entire
night, as we had made our camp over the home of a
family of <i>ariranhas</i>. They had their young in a small
grotto in the bank, and we heard them all night squealing
for their mothers, who were grinding their teeth
and shrieking furiously a little way off from the bank,
not daring to enter their homes while we were near.
They were, I think, more frightened of the fire which
my men had made than they were of us. There were
twenty or thirty of them, and they made so much
noise during the night that it was quite out of the
question to rest. The vegetation was very thick,
the damp considerable, and the air quite stifling, with
a minimum temperature of 60&deg; F. Occasionally, when
the air moved at all, we could smell our friend the
dissected <i>sucuri&uacute;</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-166" id="Pg_2-166"></a>[<a href="./images/2-166.png">166</a>]</span>
We were glad to leave at eight o'clock the next
morning; we seldom could make an earlier start, owing
to the slowness of my men in getting their breakfast
and mine ready, and reloading the canoe, as all the
baggage was taken out every night. Where we had
made camp, Victor Emmanuel Island came to an
end, the length of the island being some 14 kil. We
had great fun just before leaving, the <i>ariranhas</i> coming
boldly to attack us as we were getting into the canoe.
Our dogs, which had been squealing and growling the
whole night at the unmusical shrieks of the <i>ariranhas</i>,
now jumped into the water, and there was a fierce
fight between them and the amphibious animals. My
men, as usual, fired a great many shots. Eventually
we recovered our dogs and started off once more on
our journey.</p>

<p>The river flowed from that point at first mostly in
a north-easterly direction and in a somewhat winding
course; then gradually tended toward the north-west.
In the western part of a large basin 1,200 m. broad
were two islands and innumerable rocks. Then,
farther on, one more long rocky barrier extended from
north-west to south-east in the north-western part of
the basin. Once more did we have to let the canoe
down the terrific rapids by means of ropes.</p>

<p>Where the river turned to the north-west it was
500 m. wide and most beautiful. A great many islands
were seen, and innumerable rocks barred the entrance
of the channel at the end of the basin above described.
Soon after, however, we entered another basin
1,000 m. wide, with more islands and rapids fairly easy
to negotiate. Once more did the river turn due north<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-167" id="Pg_2-167"></a>[<a href="./images/2-167.png">167</a>]</span>
for 6,000 m., after we had gone over another swift and
most troublesome rapid, where we had to unload our
baggage and take the canoe down carefully with ropes.
After that we entered a long channel strewn with rocks.
We had not gone far when another strong rapid was encountered,
over another great barrier of rock. No sooner
had we negotiated that difficult passage than another
great barrier of rock, also from south-west to north-east,
had to be gone over through a troublesome rapid.</p>

<p>My men were getting tired of exploring, and
were perplexed, because the more dangers we surmounted
the greater seemed the dangers confronting
us. They were beginning to lose the nerve they had
temporarily acquired, and were now so scared at the
vicious waters that they tried to keep the canoe all
the time close to the banks or islands, the river being
so deep that they thought this was the best way of
saving their lives in case we had a bad accident. The
current was extraordinarily swift, and to make things
worse a strong north-easterly wind blew with great
fury, driving us back and producing such high waves
that our canoe was constantly filled with water. The
result of keeping so close to the bank, and having our
heads continually brushed by the foliage which overhung
the stream, was that each time we came in contact
with the branch of a tree thousands of ants would
drop on to the canoe and upon us, and would bite us
furiously. This was most trying&mdash;an additional torture
to that we had to endure of being stung all over
by other insects which followed the canoe in swarms.</p>

<p>We had not gone much farther along when within
1,000 m. we came to three nasty rapids in succession,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-168" id="Pg_2-168"></a>[<a href="./images/2-168.png">168</a>]</span>
over barriers of great rocks intersected by interesting
veins of quartz. From that point the river was fairly
straight for 7 kil. We had that morning encountered
five troublesome rapids, which had given us endless
work. When we halted we were simply ravenous.
We were fortunate enough to get plenty of fish for
lunch, and while my men were enjoying a hearty feast
I took the usual astronomical observations, eaten all
over as I was by mosquitoes and <i>piums</i>, while bees
innumerable had settled on my face and arms. The
latitude was 9&deg; 40&#8242;&middot;4 S.; the longitude 58&deg; 34&#8242; W. The
bees had a most peculiar pungent odour, which they
seemed to leave on one's skin when they had walked on
it. We kept our heads wrapped up in towels; but even
then we suffered a great deal.</p>

<hr />
<p>When we started in the afternoon we continued to
travel in a direction of 330&deg; b.m., and came to a large
basin, easily identifiable by subsequent travellers by
three extensive domes of granite on the right side,
two of them actually on the bank of the stream at the
entrance of the basin. Where an elongated island,
3,000 m. long&mdash;Oriana Island&mdash;beside which we had
travelled, ended on our left, we saw another island that
continued half-way down the basin, here some 2,000 m.
wide. The second island&mdash;Diana Island&mdash;was fully
8,000 m. in length. In the centre of this great basin
was a triangular island&mdash;Pomona Island&mdash;4,000 m. long
and with a base of 1,500 m. A tributary was visible
on the right bank, just opposite a great dome of granite
with an appendix of sand and gravel which stood in
the middle of the channel. After we had travelled for
2,500 m., a basin some 1,400 m. wide opened again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-169" id="Pg_2-169"></a>[<a href="./images/2-169.png">169</a>]</span>
with a small island, 400 m. long, in the centre&mdash;M.
Adams Island. This charming islet had a picturesque
headland of rock on the south side, and a long spur,
also of rock, to the north. We made our camp here.
The river was really marvellously beautiful at this
point, the vegetation all round being vigorous and
healthy, with a great wealth of rubber trees, while the
huge volcanic rocks strewn about added much to the
picturesqueness of the scene.</p>

<p>It was warm during the night (minimum temperature
63&deg; F.), and we were treated to a most tormenting
concert of mosquitoes. They swarmed positively in
millions around us. With my bed and bedding which
I had lost in the rapids I had unfortunately also lost
my mosquito net, and I now was suffering greatly
from the stings of all the troublesome insects. My
bones were aching all over from sleeping on the uneven
packing-cases placed in a row which now formed my
bed. It took too much time and trouble to unfasten
the straps and buckles which kept the boxes tightly
closed, and they did not add to the comfort when one
lay spread on them.</p>

<p>When we left in the morning of July 28th, going
along a beautiful stretch of close upon 25 kil. in great
expanses from 4,000 to 6,000 m. long, we passed first
of all an elongated quadrangular island 1,500 m. long;
then farther on great masses of volcanic rock. At
the end of that stretch the river divided into two
channels separated by an equilateral-triangular island,
the side of which was 2,000 m.&mdash;Minerva Island. Another
island, also of great beauty, and with a considerable
number of rubber trees upon it, was found a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-170" id="Pg_2-170"></a>[<a href="./images/2-170.png">170</a>]</span>
little farther, and there a bar of sand spread beneath
shallow water right across the stream.</p>

<p>We had gone 31,500 m. that morning. When we
found a most beautiful beach of lovely sand we could
not resist the temptation of halting on it to prepare
our lunch. Our surprise was great when we set foot
on the beach to hear shrill whistles beneath us. The
beach was formed of whistling&mdash;or singing&mdash;sand. The
reason the sand was musical was because some large
insects had bored thousands of holes of great depth into
its moistened mass, which allowed the holes to retain
their form. When the sand was trodden the pressure
drove the warmish air contained in those holes with
great force through the contracted apertures and caused
a sharp whistling and occasionally quite melodious
notes.</p>

<p>I again took observations for latitude and longitude
at this place, but I was beginning to find the
work too heavy&mdash;not the observing in itself, but the
computing of all the observations, at which I was not
particularly quick. (Lat. 9&deg; 24&#8242; S.; Long. 58&deg; 40&#8242; W.)
Also, the great care which I had to take of the chronometer
under most difficult circumstances was a trial to
me, considering the numberless things I had to look
after. The only little comfort I had on that journey
had been my camp bed, on which I could, if not sleep
soundly, at least rest my weary bones for a few hours
at night. That had now gone, and I was beginning
to feel the strain of the hard work, constant mental
exertion, and the total lack of rest.</p>

<p>We had passed a great number of islands in the
morning: one 2,000 m. long&mdash;Melusine Island; another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-171" id="Pg_2-171"></a>[<a href="./images/2-171.png">171</a>]</span>
300 m.&mdash;Janus Island; a third 3,000 m.&mdash;Midas Island&mdash;by
the side of which was another enormous island,
some 6,000 m. in length&mdash;Miranda Island. Then little
islets 200 and 250 m. long, and another big island,
2,000 m. from end to end&mdash;A. Mas&otilde; Island.</p>

<p>Most beautiful sandy beaches were now constantly
seen, mostly, like the one on which we had landed,
composed of singing sand. (Some of those beaches
were 200 and 300 m. long.) The beach on which we
had landed for lunch was at the southern end of a
great island, 5,700 m. long, which I named Queen Mary
Island.</p>

<p>We left again that afternoon, travelling fairly
speedily, chiefly in W.N.W. and S.S.W. directions, varying
from 290&deg; b.m. to 230&deg; b.m. When we came to the
end of Queen Mary Island, after passing some really
remarkable beaches on which we found a great many
turtles' eggs, we came to a large basin, 1,800 m. across,
with numberless rocks scattered on the north and south
sides of it. The river there flowed due west; in fact,
those rocks formed a kind of corona all around the
great circle. A crescent-shaped island, 2,800 m. long&mdash;Giselle
Island&mdash;was next passed. The channel
through which we went was full of dangerous rocks, and
had a width of 280 m.</p>

<p>Soon after another basin 1,600 m. broad was reached,
with a formidable barrier of islets and rocks spreading
from south to north. The river there flowed in a perfectly
straight course for 10 kil. to 310&deg; b.m. A most
extraordinary-looking islet with a circular terrace of
rock on the east side of it, which was passed in mid-stream,
was surrounded by a giant crown of pyramidal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-172" id="Pg_2-172"></a>[<a href="./images/2-172.png">172</a>]</span>
rocks of great height emerging in sharp points from
the water. We had gone but 6,000 m. of that distance
when we came to an island on the right side with a
gorgeous spit, also of musical sand, 300 m. long. The
island itself was only 700 m. long including the sand-spit&mdash;Kuvera
Island. We were then in an immense
basin with leaden waters as still as those of a pond.</p>

<p>We made our camp in a most picturesque spot, an
immense beach forming innumerable indentations, really
like small dunes of sand deposited by water. The
accurate elevation of that place was, according to the
observations taken with the hypsometrical apparatus,
967 feet, water boiling at that spot at 210&deg; 3&frac34;, and
the temperature of the atmosphere being 72&frac12;&deg; F. The
indented beach, not unlike a giant double-comb, was
at the beginning of a great island which I named James
Dewar Island, in honour of the great discoverer of
liquid air. The minimum temperature during the
night of July 29th was 55&deg; F.</p>

<p>Since we had come to the enormous sand accumulations
along the stream the troublesome insects which
worried us day and night seemed to have doubled or
trebled in numbers, and we suffered positive torture
from them, especially when we landed anywhere.</p>

<p class="figcenter">(The water revolved in three different directions in succession.)</p>
<hr />
<p>We left fairly early in the morning, finding soon
afterwards a group of sharply pointed rocks, some
above the surface of the stream, some&mdash;most dangerous&mdash;just
under the surface. Another basin, 1,000 m.
broad, was crossed, which contained two islets and a
number of rocks forming a barrier from south-west to
north-east. Two kilometres farther along another immense
barrier of rocks and numberless islets obstructed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-173" id="Pg_2-173"></a>[<a href="./images/2-173.png">173</a>]</span>
the river from south-west to north-east, so that for a
little time we could not see which way the stream
flowed out of it at all. Sharply-pointed rocks, ugly
and fearsome-looking, stood up everywhere. When
eventually we did perceive a channel, down which we
went, we found terrifying rapids followed by fearful
eddies and a most alarming whirlpool.</p>

<p>I could not measure the exact width of the basin
there, as there was a regular maze of islands and I
could not well see from the canoe where the banks
exactly were.</p>

<p>A great island, 2,000 m. long&mdash;Normand Island&mdash;presently
divided the river into two great channels, the
north-easterly one of which we followed, finding more
fearsome rapids and strong eddies, which knocked the
canoe and us about in a dangerous manner.</p>

<p>I was greatly concerned in going down all those
rapids, as the canoe was now in a pitiable condition.
We had no way of repairing her, and I was afraid that,
with the strain of the terrific current, if we had banged
too hard against a rock, she might have split in two.
I was not so anxious for myself as I was for my men,
who would certainly have been drowned, as four of
them could not swim. Also, after all the trouble I had
taken to make valuable botanical collections and a
unique collection of photographs, I was most anxious
to bring them all back safely. I was particularly
anxious to bring back to Europe the wonderful fossils
I had collected on the Plateau of Matto Grosso, which
I had long ago packed in one of the cases that were
fortunately among the things saved from the previous
disasters. My men had invariably grumbled at having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-174" id="Pg_2-174"></a>[<a href="./images/2-174.png">174</a>]</span>
to carry that particular heavy box, when we had to
unload the canoe and take the baggage on our heads or
shoulders at the many rapids we had encountered.
They had never once missed an occasion to remonstrate
and swear at the absurdity of having to sweat to carry
"those blessed stones," or "the devil's own stones,"
as they called them.</p>

<p>We had gone but a few thousand metres when we
once more came to another great barrier, with two
islands, stretching, like most of the others, from south-west
to north-east. The only point at which we could
take the canoe down was in the rapid in the very centre
of the stream&mdash;a nasty-looking place, I can assure you&mdash;followed
by a whirlpool of such proportions as would
have frightened most humans. I must say for my
men that they showed a great deal of courage that day.
Whether it was because they did not quite realize the
danger, or whether it was because they had got accustomed
to it by then, I do not know; but the fact remains
that when I ordered them to go down that
terrifying place they obeyed without saying a word.</p>

<p>We had to exercise the greatest care, having to
jump out on small rocks which stuck up in the middle
of the rapid in order to arrest the almost uncontrollable
speed of the canoe. Had they missed their footing while
jumping on those rocks and holding the ropes attached
to the canoe, the men would certainly have lost their
lives, as it was out of the question to save anybody in
those diabolical waters. Therefore, when you considered
the terrific speed at which the canoe was travelling,
and that the men must have known that a mistake
in judging the distance would have meant utter de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-175" id="Pg_2-175"></a>[<a href="./images/2-175.png">175</a>]</span>struction,
you could not but admire them for their really
amazing self-confidence. On many occasions, indeed, I
had to do the same thing myself, but I must say I never
liked it much; although I was in a better position
than they were, as I am a good swimmer&mdash;not that a
swimmer would have much chance in those waters.</p>

<p>A number of islets were seen below the rapids and
whirlpool. From that point we discerned on the right
bank an elongated hill, 100 ft. high. Slightly beyond,
preceded by a great mass of rock, was another island
200 m. long, dividing the stream in two. Two other
islands, one 700 m. long&mdash;Leda Island&mdash;the other one
Medea Island, of greater length but much narrower,
were disclosed behind it.</p>

<p>Then came another great barrier of rocks extending
from south-west to north-east, and more rapids to
be negotiated. A series of elongated islets and sand-banks
occurred in the basin which followed, 1,300 m.
wide. Beautiful sand-beaches had formed on either
side of that lovely bay. The river then narrowed again
to a width of 500 m., and we saw a long flat island of
sand, 200 m. long and 50 m. wide, enclosed by rocks
in the centre of the stream.</p>

<p>We continued our journey, after the usual halt for
taking astronomical observations, and had before us a
small hill 100 ft. high at bearings magnetic 300&deg;.</p>

<p>We came to a series of most dangerous rapids with
terrific whirlpools, especially after the first and second
rapid. Another great barrier of rocks with huge
boulders spread across the stream from south-west to
north-east. An isolated hill was to be seen on the
left bank where this barrier was found. A strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-176" id="Pg_2-176"></a>[<a href="./images/2-176.png">176</a>]</span>
coffin-shaped boulder of immense size was then reached
on the right side of the stream, just after we had passed
a delightful sand-spit 100 m. long enclosed within a
stockade of pillar-like rocks.</p>

<p>From this point we had 4,000 m. of clear navigation
to 280&deg; b.m. It seemed heavenly to us to
be in smooth waters again, and my men flattered
themselves that we had now come to the end of the
rapids altogether. But we soon arrived at innumerable
rocks in a confused mass right across the stream, between
which the river flowed with great force in a
contracted neck. We passed between two islands,
each 200 m. long, at the end of which was a rapid.
An island 1,000 m. long was there formed&mdash;Bomfin
Island. Dangerous rapids occurred half-way down its
length on the right; then followed a mass of square
columnar pillars of rock not unlike basalt. That was
all very beautiful to look at, but we had endless trouble
in extricating our canoe from among the numberless
impedimenta which obstructed navigation.</p>

<p class="fsc">At the August Falls.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another most beautiful island, 520 m. long&mdash;Jessica
Island&mdash;was passed just before getting to really formidable
rapids, down which we had the greatest difficulty
in letting the canoe, even by the judicious use of ropes.
The navigable channel of the river&mdash;if navigable it
could be called&mdash;swerved from north-west to due north.
In a basin of immense size were a number of islands
from 300 to 200 m. in length, and enormous boulders
with cataracts of great height between. The roar made
by the water falling over was so great that it resembled
thunder. The difference of height between the top
and the bottom of the rapid was not less than 10 ft.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-177" id="Pg_2-177"></a>[<a href="./images/2-177.png">177</a>]</span>
The water in the channel we followed went over a
great slope of lava above which numerous boulders
had accumulated.</p>

<p>My men became perplexed when they saw the formidable
rush of water, but before we had time to do
anything we were swept away at such a speed that for
one moment I really believed we were lost. My men
laughed hysterically, and in that laugh I joined when
we came out at the other end still alive. We had
shaved several rocks so closely that great patches of
the stopping in the side of the canoe had been torn off
altogether, and we were filling fast with water.</p>

<p>Our merriment did not last long, for in a few
moments we had drifted on to another and worse rapid,
much more terrific than the one we had just gone
over. We just managed to hold the canoe on the
upper edge of the foaming stream, trying to get the
ropes ready in order to let her down. We were in mid
stream, not less than 200 m. away from the right bank.
We unloaded a portion of the baggage on the rocks and
proceeded to let the canoe down with ropes&mdash;a most
dangerous job in that particular rapid, because at the
end of the rush of water stood up many rocks, which
drove the water back again and eventually switched
it off, curling over itself at a very sharp angle on one
side and on the other. A diabolic-looking whirlpool of
great depth formed on the other side of those rocks.</p>

<p>I fully realized that the strength of us seven men
was hardly sufficient to hold the canoe, particularly as
all of us were immersed waist-deep and could scarcely
keep our footing in that great rush of water. It was
only with the greatest care that we could possibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-178" id="Pg_2-178"></a>[<a href="./images/2-178.png">178</a>]</span>
accomplish the feat, and of this I warned my men.
In fact, the moment the canoe came down at an angle
on the steep incline she gave such a mighty jerk that
my men, with the exception of Alcides, let go the
ropes. Some of them had the skin taken clean off
their fingers. I saw the canoe give a great leap.
To my horror, a moment after the canoe had passed
me down the rapid&mdash;I was holding one of the ropes at
the lower part of the rapid&mdash;I saw Alcides, who bravely
had never let the rope go, being carried away in the
current. I just managed to grab him as he was about
to be drawn into the vortex, where most certainly he
would have lost his life. I lost my footing too, and we
were both thrown against a rock, which I grabbed with
one hand while still holding on to Alcides. There we
remained powerless for several minutes, swallowing a
good deal of water, which went right over our heads
with the resistance we made against the current, until
Filippe the negro&mdash;with wonderful courage, since he
was no swimmer&mdash;came to our rescue.</p>

<p>Alcides was undoubtedly a brave man, but he
certainly had a beastly temper. No sooner had he
recovered from the accident than I heard some of the
other men tell him that he had had a narrow escape
and would have died had I not gone to his rescue.
Shouting aloud so that I could hear his remark, he said
to the men: "Oh, the Englishman only came to my
rescue because there was no danger for him, as he could
swim, or else he would not have done it."</p>

<p class="fsc">Author and his Men in Water up to their Necks for an Entire Night endeavouring to save their Canoe, which in shooting a Rapid had become stuck between Rocks.</p>
<hr />
<p>There was no time to lose, and certainly no time
for argument. The canoe had most unluckily got stuck
at the bottom of the rapid between two rocks, her fore-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-179" id="Pg_2-179"></a>[<a href="./images/2-179.png">179</a>]</span>part
being absolutely submerged. The vibration was
such in the after-portion which stuck out of the water
that I thought any moment she might break in two.</p>

<p>All my men behaved that day with marvellous
courage&mdash;particularly Filippe, who, much delighted by
the words of praise I gave him when he risked his life
in coming to our rescue, now offered to risk his life once
more in endeavouring to seize one of the ropes which
had got loose and was dangling from the canoe in the
foaming waters. We tied Filippe with a rope which
we removed from one of the packing-cases we had
previously landed, and let him down the rapid until he
was thrown violently against the canoe. There the
plucky fellow was able to get inside and recover the
ropes, which he, after repeated attempts, flung on to
us. We pulled and pulled for several hours, but the
canoe was so jammed between the rocks, and the current
was so strong, that we were not able to get her off.</p>

<p>Night had come on, and we were still waist-deep in
the water and trembling with cold, trying to save
the canoe. She would not move in any direction. It
was with some concern that I had seen several articles
which had been loose in the canoe being washed out
into the water and disappearing in the whirlpool.
Then came a worse accident still. While trying to
unload two heavy cases of provisions&mdash;a ticklish job&mdash;the
men lost their footing in the current and one after
the other the packing-cases also disappeared in the
whirlpool.</p>

<p>All these disasters following one another within a
few hours were rather trying to us, the loss of the
provisions particularly giving me a great shock, as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-180" id="Pg_2-180"></a>[<a href="./images/2-180.png">180</a>]</span>
realized now that we had practically nothing else left
to eat except what we could find by shooting or fishing.</p>

<p>When the canoe had been made lighter we succeeded
by constantly jerking her in moving her slightly,
and eventually, at two o'clock in the morning&mdash;the
accident having occurred at half-past four in the afternoon&mdash;we
were able to release her and bring her to
safety along the bank.</p>

<p>A great hole had been opened in the side of the
canoe where she had struck the rock, and we had to
beach her in order to keep her afloat till the morning.
Then came the heavy task of taking all the baggage from
the rocks in the centre of the stream along the great
barrier of sharp cutting stones as far as the bank.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-180.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-180_th.jpg" alt="The Salto Augusto from Above." title="The Salto Augusto from Above." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">The Salto Augusto from Above.</p>
<hr />
<p>We were prostrate with fatigue when we had accomplished
all the work. I lay down on the ground to
rest; my men fortunately had saved their hammocks,
as they were the first things they always took care
to save whenever there was a calamity. Not once
during the whole journey did my men offer me one
of their hammocks when they saw me sleeping with
great discomfort on packing-cases or on the ground.
Certainly I was too proud to ask them for any favour.</p>

<p>I had hardly gone to sleep when I thought I heard
a curious noise by my side, as of something dragging
along the ground. I immediately jumped up, and
saw a huge snake some 20 ft. long inquisitively looking
at me, only half a metre away. I do not know which of
us two was more surprised. The snake with sinuous
grace moved away from me with gradually accelerated
speed, and, passing right under the hammocks of my
men, disappeared in the forest behind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-181" id="Pg_2-181"></a>[<a href="./images/2-181.png">181</a>]</span>
Taking all things into consideration, that was a
night worth remembering. What was worst of all was
the fact that, with the excitement and the fatigue, I
had forgotten to wind the chronometer at the usual
hour of seven o'clock in the evening, and when I woke
up startled in the morning, remembering the fact, I
found the chronometer had stopped altogether. That
was the greatest blow of all, after all the trouble I had
taken to keep the Greenwich mean time for my observations
of longitude. The mishap was not irreparable,
as I got the time fairly accurately by using the
previous observations at local noon and working out
the difference with Greenwich mean time.</p>

<p>So many had been the obstacles we had found that
day that, before reaching the rapid where we had the
disaster, we had made a progress of 39 kil. 500 m.&mdash;poor
work indeed as compared to the wonderful distances
we had been able to cover on the first days of
our navigation of the Arinos River. Considering all,
however, it was really marvellous that we could cover
even that distance, short as it was.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> thermometer that night, July 30th, showed a
minimum of 63&deg; F. We repaired the large hole (about
1 ft. in diameter) in the side of the canoe by stuffing
it with a pair of my pyjamas, while one or two shirts
which I still had left were torn to shreds in order to
fill up the huge crack which went from one end of the
canoe almost to the other, and which had become
opened again in scraping rocks in the rapid.</p>

<p>We did not leave that camp until 11 o'clock a.m.
An isolated hill was visible on the left bank. We had
gone some 3,000 m. when we came to another fairly
strong rapid. My men were quarrelling among themselves.
Alcides, who was fond of gesticulating on such
occasions, let the steering gear go in order to give more
force to his words by waving his hands in the air,
regardless of the danger which was in front of us, with
the result that the canoe turned a pirouette upon herself
and down the rapid we went backwards.</p>

<p>The river flowed from that place in an easterly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-183" id="Pg_2-183"></a>[<a href="./images/2-183.png">183</a>]</span>
direction for some 3,000 m., where a great basin was
formed, strewn with rocks and islets and having two
large islands in its eastern part. The basin in its
widest part had a width of 2,000 m. Then from that
point the river went to 50&deg; b.m. for a distance of
6,000 m. A strong north-easterly wind was blowing
against us, keeping us back and making our work unduly
hard. Great waves tossed us about and made
my men seasick, while we got splashed incessantly,
the moisture we absorbed being each time quickly
evaporated by the fierce wind. We felt cold and
shivery and not particularly happy after the experience
of the previous night.</p>

<p>Benedicto, who had been entrusted during the
journey with the baling out of the canoe, was beginning
to find his job too much for him&mdash;a job which he had
volunteered to do at first when the canoe was not
leaking. He now said he wanted to paddle and not
bale out the water any more. Although we used a
big bucket for that purpose, Benedicto had all his
work cut out for him in keeping the canoe only half
full of water.</p>

<p>Several times I remonstrated with him that day,
as while I was sitting behind him with the wind
blowing hard, he flung most of the water on me instead
of back into the stream.</p>

<p>I had observed for the last few days a little globular
white cloudlet to the north, just above the horizon.
Every day that cloudlet was to be seen in the very same
position, where it remained motionless most of the day
upon the otherwise beautifully clear blue sky. That
was an indication to me that we must be nearing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-184" id="Pg_2-184"></a>[<a href="./images/2-184.png">184</a>]</span>
great fall of water or an immense rapid, which caused
the evaporation of the water to produce it.</p>

<p>Many were the islands we passed that day, some as
much as 800 m. in length. One island, particularly,
was picturesque to a degree, with an impressive crown
of rock on its westerly side. The river was there some
2,000 m. wide&mdash;perhaps even more, as I could not
quite see how far the bank was to the left of us owing
to some islands which stood in the way.</p>

<p>A barrier of islands describing a crescent then stood
before us, the largest island of that group being 800 m.
wide and several kilometres long&mdash;Belinda Island. I
did not measure the exact length of this island, as we
got into great trouble there in some strong rapids, and
I had to leave my notebooks for a moment in order
to assist poor Benedicto in baling out the water so that
we could keep afloat.</p>

<p>When our course turned to 10&deg; b.m. we came into
full view of a high range to the north of us which
spread from north-west to south-east. The river had
cut its way right through it. We reached a great basin
again, 2,000 m. broad like its predecessor, with four
beautiful islands abreast, and a number of other islands
varying from 100 to 500 m. in length behind them, in
the centre, while rocks innumerable were scattered
about. There was a rapid once more, with a nasty
succession of strong whirlpools formed by the deviation
of the swift waters encountering the many rocks.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-184.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-184_th.jpg" alt="The Upper Terrace of the August Waterfall." title="The Upper Terrace of the August Waterfall." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">The Upper Terrace of the August Waterfall.</p>
<hr />
<p>Beyond the rapids we got a full view of the range
before us, which extended from 90&deg; b.m. to 320&deg;. We
had hardly recovered from negotiating those eddies
when we were confronted by yet another strong rapid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-185" id="Pg_2-185"></a>[<a href="./images/2-185.png">185</a>]</span>
impossible to navigate, where we had to let the canoe
down by means of ropes.</p>

<p>The river here was most picturesque, in great
straight stretches from 3,000 to 9,000 m. in length.
Some 4,000 m. farther down we came to a very bad
rapid. My men were extremely tired of unloading and
reloading the canoe all the time with the heavy baggage
which still remained. They became most ill-tempered
when this new rapid appeared before us, blaming me, as
it were, for the rapid being there. I told them that
if they did not care to unload all they had to do was
to shoot the rapid. They quarrelled among themselves.
When we got near it my men became terrified.
Alcides, who was at the steering gear, mentioned the
fact that we should all be drowned in a few moments.
He became perplexed when we entered the rapid,
which tossed the canoe about in a merciless manner.
In one place, where the water, driven through with great
force along a narrow channel, formed a central wave
of great height, the canoe stood up almost vertically
on her stern. Baggage and men all slid down in a
heap. The next thing I saw, when the canoe righted
herself, was that we were going down the rapid sideways
and at a really vertiginous pace. We managed
to clear by a mere hair's-breadth two great rocks
which stood in the way. Had we struck a rock on
that particular occasion we certainly should have all
been killed. As luck would have it, before we knew
what was happening we were shot into the whirlpool
under the rapid, and there we turned round upon ourselves
three or four times before my men had recovered
from the amazement of finding themselves still alive,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-186" id="Pg_2-186"></a>[<a href="./images/2-186.png">186</a>]</span>
and had begun to paddle again after I had told them
to do so for the twentieth time.</p>

<p>Filippe the negro exclaimed: "As long as we come
with you, sir, we shall never be killed, but you let us
go very near death sometimes!" Then they discussed
among themselves, saying that I must have some
particular mascotte which I carried upon my person
and which prevented disaster.</p>

<p>The range which was before us to the north-west
developed itself into a flat-topped hill mass about
500 ft. above the level of the river.</p>

<p>Another rapid, fairly violent, was reached some
distance beyond, my men this time offering at once,
of their own accord, to unload the canoe and take her
down carefully with ropes. I pretended not to care,
as I wanted to give them a lesson, and said we had
better shoot it, as we had done the previous one.</p>

<p>"No, no, no, no!" they all said in a chorus;
"there is such a thing as tempting Providence!"</p>

<p>As we got farther down I could perceive that the
range extended much farther than I had seen earlier
in the day; in fact, from the W.N.W. it spread as far
as E.S.E.</p>

<p>Below the last rapid was an island of great beauty&mdash;Babin
Island&mdash;2,000 m. long. The river beyond
that island formed two arms, one on each side of a
triangular island located in the opening formed in the
hill range by the river, where another strong rapid&mdash;in
fact, a regular small waterfall&mdash;was to be found.</p>

<p>It was very difficult to keep count of all the islands
which we constantly passed&mdash;many elongated, others
triangular, others rectangular, others of all kinds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-187" id="Pg_2-187"></a>[<a href="./images/2-187.png">187</a>]</span>
irregular shapes. In my note-books I endeavoured
to map out the entire course of the river as well as I
could, and I think that, considering the amount of
other work I had to do and the difficulties encountered
all the time, the map I made to the scale of one centimetre
to a kilometre is as accurate as it could possibly
be made with the means at my command. In places
where I was uncertain I have left blanks in the map,
and have not gone in for the usual method of certain
geographers of filling up the space with all kinds of
shadings in order to make it look pretty.</p>

<p>We had gone that day 46 kil., the current having
been very strong all the time, which made up for the
loss of time in dealing with the many rapids.</p>

<p>I took altitude observations with the hypsometrical
apparatus, water boiling at that spot at
210&deg; 3&frac12;, the temperature of the air being 78&deg; F.
The minimum temperature during the night of July 30th
was 63&deg; F.</p>

<p>We began our journey the next morning by going
down a bad rapid and across an awe-inspiring whirlpool.
There again we had to lead the empty canoe down
with ropes, and even so we had difficulty in getting
her through safely.</p>

<p>We were in a region of immense volcanic domes
composed of eroded rock, with many small perforations
and large holes 2 or 3 ft. in diameter, highly
polished inside as if they had been varnished. Those
rocks were similar to those I had met in the higher
part of the plateau of Matto Grosso. Some of the holes
in the rock had been enlarged to a great extent by the
water of the river revolving inside them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-188" id="Pg_2-188"></a>[<a href="./images/2-188.png">188</a>]</span>
After we had passed the great whirlpool we found
many curious mounds of sand 20 ft. high among great
masses of lava and eruptive rock. Those mounds were
formed by musical sand such as we had met before.
We called it in this particular place "moaning sand,"
as instead of whistling as usual it produced a wailing
sound like the cry of a hungry puppy.</p>

<p>On the right side of the stream we came to an
important tributary 50 m. wide; 500 m. lower down
another strong rapid was reached. I was greatly
amused to see how my men now invariably pulled up
the canoe when we perceived a rapid and unloaded her,
carefully taking her down with ropes. One man,
nevertheless, had to be in the canoe to steer her.
Alcides always volunteered to take the job.</p>

<p class="fsc">Interesting Geological Formation below the Salto Augusto.</p>
<hr />
<p>Two hundred metres below this rapid the river
turned a sharp corner. There we met one of the most
dangerous rapids and whirlpool I have ever seen. It
was quite awe-inspiring to look at those vicious waters,
the water in the vortex being raised like a wall two or
three feet higher than the greatest waves of the rapid
by the force with which it revolved. The entire river&mdash;which,
as we have seen, was in some places 2,000 m.
wide&mdash;was now squeezed through a narrow cut in the
hill range, two great arms of water joining directly
above that spot. The water was naturally forced
through that small opening at an incredible pace.
The high vertical rocks at the side of the small channel
which was there formed made it extremely difficult to
take the canoe down by ropes, especially as the summit
of those rocks was much cut up, and we, above, could
not keep pace with the canoe as she floated swiftly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-189" id="Pg_2-189"></a>[<a href="./images/2-189.png">189</a>]</span>
down the rapid. By fastening together a lot of ropes
which we had removed from round the different
packages we just managed to make them long enough
to undertake the dangerous task.</p>

<p>The hill range, a section of which could be seen at
that spot, clearly showed that it was made up of
gigantic blocks piled on the top of one another up
to a height of 100 ft. At high water the river level
must reach&mdash;as was evident by the erosion and other
signs upon those rocks&mdash;nearly to the summit of the
range; in fact, when I climbed to the top I found
plenty of d&eacute;bris among the rocks, undoubtedly left
there by the stream. On the north side the range
was made up entirely of gigantic slabs of lava some
15 ft. thick and lying at an angle of 60&deg; with a
dip northward. On the south side of the range I had
found, instead, great boulders which had evidently
travelled there and were much eroded. It can
easily be understood that when the water rose it
must be held up by the hill range, and form a big
lake.</p>

<p>We wasted an entire day trying to find a way to
take the canoe over the hills, as we did not dare risk
sending her down by water. My men were positively
disheartened and on the verge of revolt, as they contended
that it was all my fault that I had taken them
to a diabolical place like that. I plainly told them
that if I gave them such high wages it was because I
knew there was a great deal of risk, as I had explained
to them at the beginning of the expedition, and I
expected them to do some hard work in return.</p>

<p>"But," said the philosopher of the party, "what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-190" id="Pg_2-190"></a>[<a href="./images/2-190.png">190</a>]</span>
is the use of money to us if after working hard for
months and months we are going to be killed?"</p>

<p>I told them that that was not the moment to argue,
but to act; if they followed my orders closely, perhaps
we might all escape alive.</p>

<p>Alcides, who was certainly a hard worker, although
not always in the right direction, had a nasty accident
that day and cut his foot badly on the sharp rocks.
He was practically incapacitated for work, as he could
only stand on one leg, the other leg being contracted
with the really ghastly injury.</p>

<p>This was ill-luck, as our strength combined was not
sufficient for the work we had to do, and now the loss
of one man&mdash;the best of my followers&mdash;was an extra
trial at the most inopportune moment.</p>

<p>The canoe, too, was in a wretched condition after
all the many accidents we had had, and we possessed
no more tar, and could spare no more clothes, to stop
up the leakages which were now plentiful all over her
bottom.</p>

<p>The day of July 31st was thus absolutely lost. I
was on the verge of abandoning the canoe there
altogether and attempting to get down along the banks
of the river on foot&mdash;which would have been almost
suicidal, as we never could have reached a place of
safety.</p>

<p>Night came. At sunset we had the usual concert
of mosquitoes, all kinds of insects and frogs, in such
innumerable quantities that the din made by them
collectively was so loud as to resemble the sound of an
iron foundry or a battle-ship in course of construction,
the sounds produced by the millions of nocturnal singers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-191" id="Pg_2-191"></a>[<a href="./images/2-191.png">191</a>]</span>
being quite metallic and reproducing exactly the sound
of hammers driving rivets into the steel plates of a
ship. Whether it was done purposely or accidentally
I do not know, but those little water creatures of the
Arinos seemed to keep excellent time, their vigour
also being most enviable.</p>

<p>On August 1st we had a minimum temperature of
64&deg; F. during the night.</p>

<p>I still saw that it was out of the question to endeavour
to take the canoe over the immense boulders
and over the hill range. One faint hope, involving
very great danger, loomed in my mind. If we could
only cross the river just above the fearsome channel we
could perhaps on the other side take down the canoe
by water. This plan required great smartness, as,
had we miscalculated the speed of the river and the
rate at which we could travel across that dangerous
water, it would surely mean certain death.</p>

<p>I spoke to my men about it. They said they were
ready to go. I explained to them that they must
paddle their hardest and not give way for a second
until we had got diagonally across the fairly still waters
only a few yards above the awful channel. Should
we by misfortune be dragged into that channel by the
current we might as well say good-bye to the world.</p>

<p>When we started on that job we risked everything.
My men behaved splendidly that day. They paddled
and paddled for all they were worth, to get across
the hundred metres or so, and took the best part of
half an hour in the formidable current. For a moment,
when the canoe was in the centre where the current
was strongest and we were making no headway, I saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-192" id="Pg_2-192"></a>[<a href="./images/2-192.png">192</a>]</span>
a bad look-out for us. I urged them on with shouts of
"<i>Rema! rema!</i>" (Row! row!) and at last, in a desperate
effort, the canoe once more moved forward.
It was a relief indeed when men and baggage were
safely landed on the opposite side.</p>

<p>All were so exhausted that for a couple of hours
it was out of the question to resume work. I occupied
that time in taking observations for altitude and
longitude, tortured to death as usual by the innumerable
bees and <i>piums</i>. (Lat. 8&deg; 54&#8242;&middot;6 S.; long.
58&deg; 51&#8242; W.)</p>

<p>The temperature in the sun was 107&deg; F. The red
and black volcanic rocks radiated such heat that we
were nearly stifled in the enclosed basin which was
formed by the hill range.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we began with the second part
of the dangerous task of endeavouring to take the
canoe through the current in a north-easterly direction.
The channel in that cut was 200 m. long and only
50 m. wide.</p>

<p>The rock was laminated in layers 6 ft. thick, which
had been subsequently baked into a solid mass. The
lower portion, of beautiful black and quite shiny,
threw up by contrast the vivid red colour of the
upper part.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-192.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-192_th.jpg" alt="The Salto Augusto (Upper Terrace)." title="The Salto Augusto (Upper Terrace)." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">The Salto Augusto (Upper Terrace).</p>
<hr />
<p>We had an exciting time when we started the canoe
with ropes down that rapid. We ran with bare feet
upon the sharp broiling rocks. We could not possibly
stand on them with our shoes on. We ran along for
all we were worth, in order to prevent the canoe escaping.
We climbed up and down great cuts from 10 to
30 ft. high in the rock, never letting go the ropes. Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-193" id="Pg_2-193"></a>[<a href="./images/2-193.png">193</a>]</span>
agility that day was remarkable. Even poor Alcides,
whose foot I had wrapped up with a piece of my shirt,
was coming along pluckily, regardless of the pain
which he certainly suffered. Once or twice, when we
remained slightly behind in that awful race, the canoe
nearly pulled us into the water from our high point on
the rocks some 30 to 50 ft. above.</p>

<p>Those 200 m. of channel seemed miles long to us.
Eventually, the canoe was brought out safely at the
other end. With bleeding feet and hands we returned
once more to our point of departure in order to convey
all our baggage upon our backs. After two or three
journeys backwards and forwards we were able to
proceed a short distance down the river, where we
could find a suitable camping-place to rest our weary
bones for the night.</p>

<p>On leaving the rapids the river took a direction of
310&deg; b.m. There was a high hill to the east and
another, equally high, to the west. The chain of hills
seen from the north showed much erosion in the centre,
where the rock was exposed underneath. On the
south side the upper portion of the hill range consisted
of a vertical rocky cliff in strata each 6 ft. thick.</p>

<p>Another cut, more unpleasant even than ours, had
been made by the river in that same range to the
north-east of that through which we had taken the
canoe. An island of rock rose between those cuts.</p>

<p>A few hundred metres below the mouth of that
ugly channel we found an extensive beach, on which
we made our camp for the night. The minimum
temperature during the night of August 2nd was 64&deg; F.</p>

<p>When we landed the men were proceeding to cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-194" id="Pg_2-194"></a>[<a href="./images/2-194.png">194</a>]</span>
down the foliage on the edge of the forest, so as to be
able to hang their hammocks, when they became
greatly excited on discovering several nests of <i>maribondos</i>
(hornets), graceful cones of a parchment-like
material enclosing a number of superposed discs from
one to three inches in diameter and about a quarter of
an inch apart. Each disc had a perforation in order
to let the dwellers in those little homes pass from one
chamber to another from the highest of the cone down
to the lowest in the apex.</p>

<p>When we left at 7.30 in the morning and had gone
but 1,800 m., the river suddenly described a sharp
angle and at that point went through a narrow neck.
Afterwards it widened once more to an average
breadth of 800 m., which it kept for a distance
of 3 kil. in a straight line, the channel being there
quite clear of rocks and the water beautifully smooth.</p>

<p>The river was indeed lovely in that part. I had a
little more time there to look round at the scenery on
either side of us. I noticed that rubber was still to be
found, but in small quantities in that region. Rubber
trees were only to be seen every now and then. Looking
back to the south and south-west on the range of
hills we had left behind, I could see that it extended
far to the north-west. The highest part of it, however,
seemed to be near the point where we had
negotiated the dangerous rapid.</p>

<p>We had gone no more than 9,600 m., when we came
to another bad rapid over a barrier of rock across the
river from north-east to south-west. A tributary 10 m.
wide at the mouth occurred on the right just before
this rapid. Beautiful trees of great height, with yellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-195" id="Pg_2-195"></a>[<a href="./images/2-195.png">195</a>]</span>
ball-like blooms, enlivened the scenery as we went
along. We had little time to appreciate the beauty
of the vegetation&mdash;we were too busy with the river.
No sooner had we got through one rapid than we
came to another alarming one, with a sudden drop of
over 6 ft. and enormous volumes of water pouring
over it.</p>

<p>This rapid described an arc of a circle, forming an
awe-inspiring whirlpool below the actual fall. We had
some trouble in finding a place where we could get the
canoe through. Eventually, with water up to our
necks, we let her gradually down the high step in the
middle of the river, we standing with great difficulty
on submerged rocks. We had then to make several
journeys backwards and forwards to convey the
various loads to the canoe after we had brought her to
a place of safety, our baggage having been left on rocks
in mid-stream. This was extremely risky work, for the
current was powerful and the water reached in some
places up to our necks. I was anxious for the men
who could not swim, as I was afraid any moment they
might be washed away, and not only should I lose
them but also the valuable instruments, photographic
plates, etc., which they were conveying across.</p>

<p>Again that day I had seen since the early morning
our friend the little white solitary cloudlet, standing
out motionless against the otherwise speckless blue sky.
Not only that, but on that particular day I could just
perceive, directly under that cloudlet, a faint column
of white mist connecting it vertically with the ground.
I knew by that sign that we could not be far off a big
waterfall; in fact, I could hear a distant rumble which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-196" id="Pg_2-196"></a>[<a href="./images/2-196.png">196</a>]</span>
made me suspect that we were much nearer than we
supposed.</p>

<p>The river was flowing to 70&deg; b.m. Two other
rapids&mdash;most violent&mdash;were reached within a short
distance of each other; then, shortly beyond these
obstacles, where the river described a graceful turn,
we had before us a great surprise. We heard a loud
roar like thunder; it had been getting louder and
louder, and grew quite deafening when we turned round
the corner. Behold! we had no more scenery upon
the horizon before us on the river, but the sky came
right down to the water. Great clouds of mist rose
up in quick succession in graceful circles. There was
an island in the centre of the stream; then to the left
of the island the sky again came right down to the
water. There a curious effect was to be seen, a high
pointed cone of water shooting up skyward with
terrific force, then rolling upon itself only to give way
to another cone of water succeeding it.</p>

<p class="fsc">Foliated Rock below the August Falls.</p>
<hr />
<p>My men were terrified when they suddenly realized
the danger which was only a few hundred metres in
front of us. There was a mighty waterfall. When
my men got excited it was generally troublesome, because
they always disagreed and started quarrelling
and insulting one another. Some of them wanted to
land at once, for fear of being dragged down the fall.
Alcides&mdash;who wanted to show his bravery on all
occasions&mdash;said there was no danger at all and we
could go in the canoe right as far as the edge of the
fall. The others naturally got somewhat scared at so
foolhardy a project. Personally I did not like to say
a word in the matter, for fear they should think that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-197" id="Pg_2-197"></a>[<a href="./images/2-197.png">197</a>]</span>
was afraid. I saw with some concern that Alcides&mdash;whose
mind, I believe, was not quite right owing to
the hardships we had endured of late&mdash;was steering
us right for the centre of the waterfall. I told him
that it would be preferable to land on the edge of the
waterfall rather than go over it, as it was a little too
high for the canoe to tumble over. I calculated the
height of the fall from 40 to 50 ft., and I was not far
wrong, for when I took accurate measurements I
found the actual height was 48 ft.</p>

<p>We were beginning to drift very speedily with the
current, when Alcides, realizing the danger, steered us
toward the right bank. The men paddled for their
lives so as to land as quickly as possible, as we were
now less than a hundred metres from the portentous
jump. The current was terrific, and the canoe was
floating sideways nearer and nearer the awful chasm.
The coast line on the right, was almost vertical, and
there was no place where we could hold on to anything
and land. So down floated the canoe, my men horror-stricken.
Once or twice they were able to seize a creeping
vine hanging down the steep bank, endeavouring to
stop the canoe's headlong career. But the creepers
gave way and crashed down upon us, nearly turning
over the canoe at the moment just before they snapped.</p>

<p>So down, down we went, until we were now only a
few metres from the fatal drop, and I saw no way of
arresting the canoe.</p>

<p>"Estamos perdidos!" (We are lost!) shouted the
men.</p>

<p>"Not yet! not yet!" I exclaimed, as I perceived
two rocks just sticking out of the water. "Make for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-198" id="Pg_2-198"></a>[<a href="./images/2-198.png">198</a>]</span>
the rocks!" I shouted to Alcides, and just as we
shaved past them I jumped quickly on one of the
rocks, holding the canoe, while two of the men also
jumped out quickly and held fast to the boat&mdash;just in
time. We were only 10 or 15 m. from the place where
the water curled over and rolled down the fall.</p>

<p>There was no time for arguing or scolding. Upon
those rocks my men, who were fond of talking, started
a brisk war of words, saying that they would
never continue the journey if Alcides were allowed to
steer again. Alcides, on the other hand, whose only
aim in life was to fight everybody and everything,
invited all the other men to a duel with their rifles. I
told them they could have the duel after we had
finished the journey and not before. We must take
the ropes, climb up to the top of the bank, and, first
of all, we must tow the canoe back to a place of safety.</p>

<p>After a great deal of shouting, angry words and
oaths, absolutely deadened by the thundering roar of
the waterfall, they took out the ropes and eventually
towed the canoe back. As soon as that was done I
went with my camera to gaze at the beautiful sight
and photograph it from different points&mdash;a job which
was not easy, as the waterfall was so encased between
vertical rocky walls (foliated in horizontal strata,
which varied in thickness from a quarter of an inch to
one foot) that it was impossible to get far enough back
to obtain a full view of it.</p>

<p>That fall, called the August Fall, was indeed a
grand sight. As I have already said, it was divided
into two separate falls, between which was an island
with a great spur of rock forming a wall between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-199" id="Pg_2-199"></a>[<a href="./images/2-199.png">199</a>]</span>
two cascades. The water flowed over that wall in
graceful steps. The fall on the right side of which I
stood was in two immense horseshoe-shaped terraces.
The continuation of those terraces on each side of the
great flow of water formed tiers of red and black volcanic
rock lying in horizontal strata so regular as to
be not unlike a gigantic Etruscan amphitheatre. The
upper tier of the fall on the right formed an arc not
less than 300 m. in periphery. The lower crescent
formed an arc 400 m. in length.</p>

<p>Upon this lower terrace the rebounding waters
were thrown up with great force into the air&mdash;the spray
forming numerous rainbows in the sun&mdash;only to drop
down once more in most contorted, diabolical curves,
boiling and roaring in their endeavour to force their
way through that positive inferno.</p>

<p>As the water came down in great volumes over
those two crescents it met once more in the centre in
a mighty clash, being flung up at a tremendous height
in the air. I do not know that I have ever seen such
a fearsome sight, or that I have ever seen water rush
with such force anywhere before. It seemed a pity
that there was no one to harness that waterfall and
use the enormous power it could generate.</p>

<p>On the left side of the river also the waterfall made
an amphitheatre of rock somewhat smaller than the
right fall. Down below, at the foot of this, it formed
huge masses of white foam, above which profuse spray
rose up like a heavy mist. Just beyond was disclosed
a diabolical whirlpool, far beyond words to describe,
which extended&mdash;as white as snow with the amount of
foam it carried, twisting and retwisting in a thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-200" id="Pg_2-200"></a>[<a href="./images/2-200.png">200</a>]</span>
circles on the surface&mdash;for over 500 m. from the lower
step of the waterfall.</p>

<p>I measured the height of the fall with a string.
The exact height of the upper terrace was 6 m. 90 cm.;
the height of the lower terrace, 7 m. 73 cm.&mdash;or a total
height of 14 m. 63 cm.</p>

<p>I also took the differential height with the several
aneroids I possessed, and the elevation with the boiling-point
thermometers above the fall and below, with a
result of 48 ft. for the actual height of the fall.</p>

<p class="fsc">Formation of Rock below the August Falls.</p>
<hr />
<p>One fact was certain, and that was that the canoe
could not possibly go down by water. There was
only one way to get out of that difficulty; that was
by taking the canoe overland until we could find a
navigable spot in the river down below. To make
things worse, there was a hill range on the right bank of
the river, on which we were. I must find a way to
make the canoe go over that hill range&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>The canoe, I might remind the reader, was 42 ft.
long and 3&frac12; ft. wide, of heavy solid wood, her bottom
being over a foot thick, her sides from 3 to 5 in. in
thickness, her stern and prow, roughly carved out, of
great thickness also. I calculated her weight at over
2,000 lb., which was well under her actual weight.</p>

<p>I spoke to my men, and told them that we must
take the canoe over the hill range. They had been
very morose since our arrival at that spot, as they expected
me to give ourselves up for lost when we came
to what they believed to be an insuperable obstacle.
They mutinied at once and took to their rifles, saying
that they would not follow a lunatic any farther, a
man who asked them to take a canoe over a hill.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-201" id="Pg_2-201"></a>[<a href="./images/2-201.png">201</a>]</span>
"Do you not know," said one of them to me, with
a fierce grin of contempt upon his face, "that canoes
are made for the water and not to travel over mountains?"</p>

<p>"Do you not know," shouted Alcides, shaking his
fist, "that it would take a hundred strong men to
lift that canoe one inch above the water?&mdash;and we,
including you, are only seven men, tired and worn.... You
believe that because you are English you can do
what you like. You will next ask the moon to come
and row in our canoe so that we may get along! You
have gone insane."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is mad!" they all said in a chorus. "We
want the balance of our pay and we will leave you at
once. Give us our money and we will go&mdash;we want
to go."</p>

<p>I told them that they could have their money as
soon as the canoe had gone over the hill and down
the other side, and certainly not before. They could
shoot me if they liked, but that would not help them
very much, as I knew the way to get on and they
did not. If they shot me they would perhaps die of
starvation themselves soon. I agreed that it was a
beautiful spot to die in, and perhaps they could hasten
their departure by jumping into the fall, and thus end
all the hardships, and, at least, arguments.</p>

<p>After those words, which I had spoken with gentleness,
I turned, and&mdash;for the first time since they had
been with me&mdash;in a stern tone of voice I ordered
Filippe and Antonio to take their big knives and proceed
to cut down ten or twelve of the straightest trees
they could find. They refused. I quietly walked to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-202" id="Pg_2-202"></a>[<a href="./images/2-202.png">202</a>]</span>
the rifle which I generally used for shooting game, and
inserted in it a clip of five cartridges. I cocked the
rifle, and, placing my watch before me on a stone, gave
the men five minutes to decide whether they would
cut the trees or be shot. I also said that if any of them
moved their rifles they would have a bullet put through
them.</p>

<p>Filippe and Antonio dropped their rifles on the
ground, reluctantly took the knives and walked
away, I pointing out to them the tall trees which I
wanted cut. I then ordered Alcides to take one of
the axes and cut thirty rollers, each about 5 ft. long.
The men were silent and yellow-faced with rage.</p>

<p>The trees in that region were easily cut down.
After a few minutes down came a tree with a crash,
and shortly after another. I walked to the men and
patted them on the back, assuring them again that
if they obeyed my orders we should soon proceed on
our journey and should certainly arrive safely at a
point where they could return home and be happy.</p>

<p>Alcides thereupon turned round asking me whether
I intended them to cut down the entire forest and
then request them to pierce a tunnel through the hill
range&mdash;or perhaps I might want the whole hill range
flattened down for my convenience!</p>

<p>I paid no attention, but ordered him to cut sixty
rollers instead of thirty. I had to keep a sharp watch
on my men that day, and I had fully decided, if any
disobedience took place, I would shoot them. I think
they thoroughly realized that, because they carried
out all my instructions to the letter.</p>

<p>When that job was done I explored the district<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-203" id="Pg_2-203"></a>[<a href="./images/2-203.png">203</a>]</span>
carefully, in order to discover which was the easiest point
over which the canoe could be made to climb the hill
range. Having found a way which I thought suitable, I
myself took one of the large knives, and ordered the
other men to come with me with all the implements
we could use in order to clear a sufficiently wide road
through which the canoe could pass. This work lasted
many hours, and was certainly trying.</p>

<p>On August 3rd we worked the entire day, from
sunrise until seven in the evening, cutting a way
through the forest. Then, when we had done that,
I constructed, with the longer trees we had cut down,
a small railway from the water, where the canoe was.
I used the rollers on these rails made of the smoothest
trees I could find. When my men grasped the idea&mdash;of
which they had never dreamed&mdash;they became very
excited and in a good humour. They worked extremely
hard. It was a portentous effort to get the
canoe on to the first roller, but once we had got her
on the first and second and third rollers, and were able
to lift her stern out of the water with levers and
pieces of wood we gradually placed under her, she
began to move along on the rollers with comparative
ease. We moved the rails in front as we went along,
and all went well until we got to the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>There the trouble began: first of all because it
was difficult to keep the rollers in position on the
rails; then also because the moment we started to
push the canoe up the hill she would slide back almost
as far as, and sometimes farther than, we had pushed
her up. By a judicious use of ropes which we made
fast to trees on either side, and by a careful study of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-204" id="Pg_2-204"></a>[<a href="./images/2-204.png">204</a>]</span>
the laws of leverage, we managed to push up the canoe
a few inches at a time. We had some narrow escapes
once or twice, when the ropes, under the excessive
strain, snapped, and the canoe slid down again, dragging
us with her. One tree, to which one of the ropes
was fastened, broke, and in its fall just missed killing
a man.</p>

<p>When once we had begun pushing the canoe up
that hill we could not leave her for a moment, as she
would at once proceed to slide back on the rollers.</p>

<p>Fourteen hours' incessant hard work saw us and the
canoe on the top of the hill. From there we had before
us a very steep descent of some 400 ft., the first 150 ft.
almost vertical.</p>

<p>My men all looked at me in a most inquisitive
way in order to find out how I should manage to
hold the canoe when we let her down that steep
incline.</p>

<p>I had fastened some pieces of wood vertically at
her stern, which, by scraping on the ground, would
hold her to a certain extent. Then, with all the ropes
we possessed we made her fast to the trees as we went
along, and let her slide gently, the weight of the canoe
being such that deep grooves were actually cut into
the trees as the ropes unwound themselves.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-204.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-204_th.jpg" alt="Photograph showing the Road cut by Author across the Forest in order to take the Heavy Canoe Overland." title="Photograph showing the Road cut by Author across the Forest in order to take the Heavy Canoe Overland." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Photograph showing the Road cut by Author across the Forest in order to take the Heavy Canoe Overland.</p>
<hr />
<p>We were only half-way down that incline when
one tree broke. The canoe gave a leap on one side,
knocking down Antonio and the man X, the jerk
immediately after breaking another tree on the opposite
side. Off went the canoe down the hill in her mad
career, knocking some of us down, dragging the others,
who were holding on to her. Two or three men were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-205" id="Pg_2-205"></a>[<a href="./images/2-205.png">205</a>]</span>
badly thrown about, but fortunately no broken bones
were recorded. The canoe by that time had, in great
leaps, reached nearly the bottom of the hill, but had
got so jammed between a rock and a big tree that it
required several hours' hard work with our axes and
knives in order to disentangle her.</p>

<p>The shock, however, had been too great for the
rickety canoe. I became anxious, for I feared she
might split in two at any time, and I had no way
of repairing her properly. When we got to the water
again I patched her up as best I could with improvised
nails which I made from pieces of hard wood. With
great yells of excitement from my men we launched
her once more in the river.</p>

<p>My men boasted how clever they had been to take
the heavy canoe over the hill. There was really nothing
Brazilians could not do when they wished!</p>

<p>Those forty hours of steady hard work out of the
forty-eight hours we had stopped at the falls had seen
us over that obstacle, and we were now ready to proceed
once more by water.</p>

<p>We had suffered a great deal during those terrible
hours from the bees, mosquitoes, hornets, <i>piums</i>, ants,
and all kinds of other insects which stung us all over.
A glance at the photographs which illustrate this
volume, of the canoe being taken across the forest,
will show all my men&mdash;I, naturally, not appearing, as
I was taking the photographs&mdash;with their heads wrapped
up in towels, notwithstanding the great heat, in order
to avoid the unbearable torture as much as possible.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature during the night of
August 3rd had been 61&deg; F.; during the night of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-206" id="Pg_2-206"></a>[<a href="./images/2-206.png">206</a>]</span>
August 4th 72&deg; F. During the day the temperature
was 88&deg; F. in the shade, but the air was quite stifling,
as the sky was overcast with heavy clouds.</p>

<p>I took careful observations for latitude and longitude
in order to fix exactly the position of the great
falls. The latitude was 8&deg; 51&#8242;&middot;1 S.; the longitude
58&deg; 50&#8242; W.</p>

<p>The whirlpool and eddies which extended for
1,000 m. below the great fall were formidable. Never
in my life have I seen waters so diabolical. They filled
one absolutely with terror as one looked at them.</p>

<p>The river flowed there to bearings magnetic 120&deg;;
then to 140&deg; b.m. for 3,000 m., where it was comparatively
smooth. To the south-east of us was a
hill range fully 600 ft. high. What appeared to me to
be a small tributary seemed to enter the river on the
left, but my men were so tired that I did not cross
over to the other side in order to make certain. On
looking behind us I could see that the hill range at the
fall extended from north-west to south-east, while
another smaller hill range, only 250 ft. above the level
of the river, stretched from north to south on the left
of the stream. The river was 300 m. wide.</p>

<p>We went no more than 9,200 m. that day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had halted on a lovely island&mdash;Adelaide Island&mdash;with
a rocky and sandy extension. The night of
August 5th had been stifling, with a minimum temperature
of 72&deg; F.</p>

<p>I found my work too much for me now. There
was too much to observe on all sides. We were travelling
quickly with the swift current. A hill range from
east to west, 300 ft. high, ran along the left bank.
Farther, where the river went to the north-east for
4,000 m., laminated rock like slate showed through the
left bank, especially in a semicircular indentation
which had been eroded by the water. There a
strong whirlpool had formed. Another great stretch of
river, 5,500 m., was now before us, with a small hill
80 ft. high on the right bank. The river next formed
a circular basin with three islets and a barrier 500 m.
across.</p>

<p>We were now in a region where, fortunately for us,
<i>castanheiro</i> trees (<i>vulgo.</i> the "Para chestnut") were
to be found. Fish was scarce in the river. Now
that we had almost superhuman work to accomplish,
our meals were extremely scanty owing to the loss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-208" id="Pg_2-208"></a>[<a href="./images/2-208.png">208</a>]</span>
of our provisions, and we had not sufficient food to
keep up our strength.</p>

<p>As we went on I saw to the north-east of us another
hill-range 300 ft. high, extending from north-west
to south-east, like most of the ranges found in that
region. Where a prominent headland stood on the
left side, with a hill 250 ft. high upon it, the river
turned to 30&deg; b.m. The hill was made up of foliated
rock lying in strata that varied from one inch to one
foot in thickness.</p>

<p>On the right side of the stream great cubic blocks
of rock rested on the polished curves of a huge dome
of granite. A quantity of d&eacute;bris stretched from south
to north right across the basin, and caused a deviation
in the stream.</p>

<p class="fsc">Conveying the Canoe across the Forest on an Improvised Railway and Rollers.</p>
<hr />
<p>A terrific rapid with a sheer drop of 3 ft. was
situated here. A double whirlpool of great magnitude
was formed at the bottom of the rapid, the water revolving
with such force that the concavity was gradually
depressed for some 3 ft. and had a great hole
in each centre. We shot that rapid. As Alcides on
that occasion followed my instructions, the canoe shot
past between the two whirlpools, and although even then
she nearly capsized, we were able to continue, my men
shrieking with merriment at what they now believed to
be their invulnerability. We dodged the unpleasant eddies
while we floated with great speed in the strong current.</p>

<p>The river, which had contracted that day to 250 m.,
now expanded once more into a large basin 1,200 m.
wide and 1,800 m. long, with most troublesome eddies
as we went through it. The river described a great
turn from N.N.E. to 180&deg; b.m. or due south.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-209" id="Pg_2-209"></a>[<a href="./images/2-209.png">209</a>]</span>
To add to the pleasures of our existence, we came
in for a heavy rain-storm that day, with deafening
thunder and blinding lightning. Notwithstanding the
great discomfort it caused us, it pleased me very much
because of the wonderful effects of light it produced
on the river.</p>

<p>Where the stream, in a course which had wriggled
like a snake, turned once more due north to 360&deg; b.m.,
it divided itself into two small channels. High waves
were produced where the water, pushed by the wind,
was forced against the rapid. There was a good drop
in the level of the river at that rapid, and it was a
nasty place indeed for us to go through. We got tossed
about, splashed all over, but we came out of it all the
same, amid the wildly excited yells of my men. They
were beginning to think that they were the greatest
navigators that had ever lived, and they never let an
opportunity pass of reminding each other of that fact.</p>

<p>I halted in the middle of the day to take the usual
observations for latitude and longitude (lat. 8&deg; 47&#8242;&middot;5
S.; long. 58&deg; 39&#8242; W.), but I was interrupted in my
work by another heavy rain-storm, which came and
drenched us once more. After that dense clouds as
black as ink covered the entire sky for the whole
afternoon. We were now in the rainy season. Terrific
gusts preceded these rain-storms, and were most
troublesome to us.</p>

<p>After negotiating the bad rapids, the river went
through a basin of boulders of broken foliated rock.
There were three small channels. Then beyond,
the entire river was forced through a rocky channel
from 35 to 40 m. wide, the water rushing through with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-210" id="Pg_2-210"></a>[<a href="./images/2-210.png">210</a>]</span>
incredible force on a steep gradient until half-way
down the channel, where it actually ran uphill for 50 m.
or so, so great was the impetus it had received on its
rapid descent to that point.</p>

<p>You can well imagine what a pleasant job it was
for us to convey the canoe along with ropes over so
delightful a spot. Owing to our insufficient food, our
strength had greatly diminished. The ropes we had
used on the many rapids were now half-rotted and tied
up in innumerable knots. Moreover, the banks of
sharp cutting rock were of great height, and our ropes
were not long enough to be used separately, so that
we decided to use only one long rope made up of all
the ropes we possessed tied together. To make matters
more difficult, the channel was not perfectly straight,
but described two or three sharp corners, where the
water was thrown with much vigour in one direction,
then, being driven off immediately at a different angle,
curled over itself, producing mountains of foaming
water forty or fifty feet in height, and leaving great
depressions near the inner corner.</p>

<p>We cut down some long poles, and I placed one
man with a big pole on guard at each corner close
to the water, in order to push the canoe away toward
the middle of the stream in case she came too near
those dangerous points.</p>

<p>That channel was some 600 m. long. When we
were ready we let the canoe go, all spare hands holding
fast to the rope, running and scrambling up and
down and along the high rocky cliff, the canoe giving
us violent jerks when the direction of the current was
changed. With much alarm we saw her spring up in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-211" id="Pg_2-211"></a>[<a href="./images/2-211.png">211</a>]</span>
the air like a flying-fish on one or two occasions. We
ran along like mad, out of breath and sweating, trying
to keep ahead of the canoe. The two men with poles
also ran along after the danger points were passed, so
as to shove her along when she came too near other
dangerous rocks.</p>

<p>After a race of great excitement, we all, with
bleeding feet and hands&mdash;the palms of our hands
actually blistered by the rope which slid through our
tightly closed fists&mdash;were eventually able to pull the
canoe safely on shore below the rapid.</p>

<p>In that mad flight I found time to pull out the
camera for one second and take a snapshot of the
canoe in the middle of the rapid. The photograph
is reproduced among the illustrations of this volume.</p>

<p>My men were so tired that it was impossible to go
on. Moreover we had before us the second section of
that formidable rapid, and we could not negotiate this
without emptying the canoe, which was full of water,
and readjusting the rope.</p>

<p>We spent the night of August 6th on those rocks,
the minimum temperature being 63&deg; F.</p>

<p>When we went on with our dangerous work the
next morning we had the greatest difficulty in saving
the canoe, as in entering the whirlpool she was swamped,
and it was all we could do to pull her back towards
the bank before she foundered altogether. The actual
drop in that rapid was not less than 8 ft. vertically.
We just managed to rest her on a submerged rock until
we were able to bale some of the water out.</p>

<p>That canoe was really wonderful in a way. My
men patted her on the prow as if she had been an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-212" id="Pg_2-212"></a>[<a href="./images/2-212.png">212</a>]</span>
animal, and said she was a good canoe. Indeed she
was, but in her old age she felt the strain of that
exciting journey. Every time I looked at her I did
not know how much longer she might last. Whatever
may be said of them, my men must be given credit for
their courage in going along in that canoe. I do not
believe that there are six other men in Brazil&mdash;or
perhaps in any other country&mdash;who would have ventured
to go across even the most placid pond in a
similar craft.</p>

<p>After the rapids came a great basin 1,000 m. long,
800 m. wide. There the river described an angle from
20&deg; b.m. to 45&deg; b.m., and we perceived two parallel
ranges before us to the N.N.E., the farther one much
higher than the one nearer. Some 5 kil. beyond was yet
another rapid, but not so troublesome a one this
time. The river there diverged from north-east to a
direction due west. A hill range, from 150 to 250 ft.
high, extended from W.S.W. to E.N.E. An isolated
hill, 300 ft. high, could be seen to the E.N.E.</p>

<p>We suffered agony that day from regular clouds of
<i>borrachudos</i>, terrible little sand mosquitoes which made
life an absolute burden in that region. Our faces,
arms, and legs were a mass of ink-black marks left by
the stings of those vicious brutes. Particularly when
our hands were occupied in holding the canoe going
down rapids, or busy with dangerous jobs, did swarms
of those little rascals attack us with indomitable fury.</p>

<p class="fsc">Pushing the Canoe Uphill through the Forest.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(Notice men with heads wrapped owing to torturing insects.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Another basin was met, 700 m. wide, quite shallow,
and with rapids over a barrier of rock extending across
it from south-west to north-east. That barrier was
most interesting, because in many places great lava-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-213" id="Pg_2-213"></a>[<a href="./images/2-213.png">213</a>]</span>flows
were visible; in other places masses of ferruginous
rock could be observed, with most extraordinary
patterns upon them&mdash;triangles, rectangles, trapeziums,
and all kinds of other angular geometrical patterns,
such as we had met before on the high plateau of Matto
Grosso.</p>

<p>We stopped in the middle of the day on an island
1,200 m. long, from which we obtained a fine view of
the hill range looming before us from W.S.W. to E.N.E.
on the right bank.</p>

<p>I was having great trouble with my chronometer,
which the many jerks, falls, and baths did not seem to
improve. I checked it whenever I could by observations
of local time and by other watches which I carried.
But all my instruments were beginning to feel the
effects of that journey very much. The wonder to
me was that they had got so far in as good condition
as they were, considering all we had gone
through.</p>

<p>Our lunch was speedy, as we had nothing to
eat. The moment I had finished my observations
for latitude and longitude we started off once more,
my men keeping their eyes all the time on the forest
on the look-out for nut-trees, the river that day giving
us no fish at all.</p>

<p>Within ten minutes we had shot two powerful
rapids, and in one place went over a dangerous submerged
wall of rock extending across the river from
E.S.E. to W.N.W.</p>

<p>The men&mdash;very hungry&mdash;were extremely quarrelsome
that day and insulting to one another. The canoe
went broadside down a rapid we met, the men gesticu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-214" id="Pg_2-214"></a>[<a href="./images/2-214.png">214</a>]</span>lating
instead of paddling along as they should have
done. With a great bump we stuck with a heavy list
to starboard on a rock in the middle of the rapid, and
presently the canoe was filled with water. Had we not
stuck fast on that rock we certainly should have
capsized. The water was baled out in due course,
the canoe was floated once more. Soon afterwards
another strong rapid, with a <i>pedraria</i> extending right
across the stream from S.S.W. to N.N.E., gave us
endless trouble.</p>

<p>I warned Alcides to get us alongside some rocks in
order that we might let the canoe down with ropes,
as the rapid, with a sheer drop of over 6 ft., looked too
dangerous for us to shoot it. But Alcides was furious
with the other men, and in order to punish them
steered the canoe into the most dangerous part of the
rapid. A second later the canoe, at an angle of 45&deg;,
was swept away down the foaming current along the
slant of the rapid, which extended there for about 15 m.
The channel was a most intricate one, with rocks
scattered all over it, so that it was absolutely impossible
for the canoe, with her great length, to go through
without having an accident.</p>

<p>As we shaved a big rock in the middle of the rapid,
and I saw the canoe steering straight for another big
rock in front, I knew disaster was imminent, and leapt
out on the rock. So frequently was it necessary for
me to do so, that I had become quite an expert at
jumping, and had acquired almost the agility of a
monkey. Alcides, too, seeing the danger, also tried
to follow my example, but unfortunately missed his
footing and was swept away by the current. I just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-215" id="Pg_2-215"></a>[<a href="./images/2-215.png">215</a>]</span>
managed to seize him before he disappeared for good,
and dragged him safely on to the rock.</p>

<p>In the meantime the canoe had swung with great
vigour and struck the big rock sideways, smashing her
side and filling at once with water. All the baggage
was swamped; only a portion of the canoe aft remained
above the water, many of our things being
washed away altogether.</p>

<p>There she stuck, fortunately for us. With considerable
danger we managed to undo the ropes which
were fastened to her stern. After several hours of
hard work&mdash;and of extreme peril for the men who
could not swim, as we had to work all the time with
the water up to our necks in a powerful current, which
made it most difficult to keep our footing&mdash;we succeeded
in pulling her off and taking her alongside the
bank.</p>

<p>That disaster was rather a serious one for us, as
it injured many of my instruments, particularly the
aneroids; but I considered myself fortunate in managing
to save all the photographs and notebooks as well
as the instruments for taking astronomical observations,
which were kept in airtight cases. I lost my favourite
pair of shoes, which were by my side in the canoe when
I jumped out.</p>

<p>As it so frequently happened that we had to jump
into the water&mdash;in fact, we spent more time in the
water than out&mdash;I had adopted as a costume my
pyjamas, under which I always wore the belt with the
heavy packages of money. The paper money&mdash;a very
considerable sum&mdash;had with the many baths become
a solid mass. I could not well spread the banknotes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-216" id="Pg_2-216"></a>[<a href="./images/2-216.png">216</a>]</span>
out in the sun to dry, as I did not wish my men to
know how much I possessed; so that for many,
many weeks I had around my waist those heavy
leather wallets soaked in water, my natural heat not
being quite sufficient to dry them.</p>

<p>We had worked in the stream until nearly midnight.
We had nothing to eat when we had finished our work,
and the result was that the next morning my men
were still tired.</p>

<p>Two of my cameras were by my side when the
canoe was swamped, one containing eighteen plates,
the other twelve, all of which had been exposed. The
cameras, being heavy, remained at the bottom of the
canoe and were saved, but the bath did not do them
good. I did not want to lose the plates, so there
was only one course to follow, and that was to develop
them while they were still wet. While my men slept
I sat up a good portion of the night developing all
those plates&mdash;quite successfully too&mdash;and trying to
clean and fix up the cameras again for use the next
day. One of my other cameras had been destroyed
previously by one of my men, who sat on it, and of
course smashed it to pieces. Another camera, which
was still in excellent condition, having been in an air-tight
case, was rather too big to be used for the work
in going down the rapids.</p>

<p>During the night of August 7th the minimum
temperature was 62&deg; F.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-216.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-216_th.jpg" alt="Conveying the Canoe, weighing 2,000 lb., over a Hill Range&mdash;The Descent." title="Conveying the Canoe, weighing 2,000 lb., over a Hill Range&mdash;The Descent." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Conveying the Canoe, weighing 2,000 lb., over a Hill Range&mdash;The Descent.</p>
<hr />
<p>I worked the entire morning with Alcides, trying
to mend the poor canoe. The hole which had been
made in her side was so big that Alcides could insert his
head into it with great ease. It was not until two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-217" id="Pg_2-217"></a>[<a href="./images/2-217.png">217</a>]</span>
o'clock in the afternoon that we started once more.
Along the river, which flowed in that particular section
to the south-west, was a hill range on the north-west.
The range rose 300 ft. above the level of the
river. We had gone only some 2,000 m. when we
came to another bad rapid stretching across the river
from south-east to north-west. We were in a hilly
region, hills being visible all along the stream. Soon
afterwards we came to another powerful fall over a
vertical rocky wall extending from north-west to
south-east. Such redoubtable waves were produced
there by the force of the water shooting over and then
rebounding upwards, that we had to use the greatest
care in letting down the unloaded canoe. At one
moment she was more than two-thirds out of the water,
only her stern resting on the top of the fall, the rest
projecting outward in the air for some moments until
she dropped down again.</p>

<p>Since the day we had taken the canoe over the hill
range at the August Falls, I had doubled my men's
salaries&mdash;although their original salaries were already
many times higher than they would receive from
Brazilian employers. I fully recognized that the work
was hard, and I wished to encourage them in every
possible way.</p>

<p>Next, the river went through a narrow gorge, only
80 m. wide, where the current was mighty strong.
High volcanic rocks stood on the right side of us.
When we emerged from the narrow neck, which measured
some 500 m. in length, we found powerful whirlpools.
Farther on the river once more went through a
bad narrow passage, 40 to 60 m. wide, with a succession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-218" id="Pg_2-218"></a>[<a href="./images/2-218.png">218</a>]</span>
of rapids&mdash;extremely unpleasant&mdash;for a length of
600 m.</p>

<p>My men were in great form that day, and we shot
one rapid after another in fine style, Alcides&mdash;for a
change&mdash;being amenable to reason and following my
instructions, which carried us through that dangerous
section without mishap. The stream Uruguatos entered
the Arinos just above the latter rapids.</p>

<p>That day was indeed a trying one for us. Another
narrow channel, 50 m. wide, was reached, along the
250 m. length of which we proceeded with great caution.
Then a big basin spread out before us, where the
current and eddies were terrific. The bottom of the
river was mostly rocky, with great holes and depressions
which caused the water to rotate in all directions. In
some places amidst the foaming waters could be seen
great circles of leaden-looking water, as still as oil.
It was in a similar place in the Niagara whirlpool that
the famous swimmer, Captain Webb, disappeared for
ever. We saw thousands of those places on the Arinos.</p>

<p>The line of the banks on both sides was extremely
rocky. In front of us we had a hill with extensive
campos on its northerly slope. Then we came to the
next rapid. We had endless trouble in this rapid,
followed by a second one, practically a continuation
of the first.</p>

<p>For 1,000 m. the navigation was extremely dangerous.
We unloaded and reloaded the canoe dozens
of times that day, although the work of taking the
baggage over on our heads was not so troublesome
now, as we had very little baggage left. But if we had
not much, it was still the heaviest cases which re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-219" id="Pg_2-219"></a>[<a href="./images/2-219.png">219</a>]</span>mained.
All together they weighed between five and
six hundred pounds. The river ran beside a range of
hills on the left side.</p>

<p>When we halted, exhausted, late at night we had
travelled that day the meagre distance of 9,900 m.</p>

<p>My men killed two large spider monkeys, which
supplied them with a meal. I could not touch them,
as the monkeys looked too human for words. It
made me positively ill to see one of my men biting with
great gusto at an arm and hand which had been
roasted on the flames, and which looked exactly like
a portion of a human corpse. The smell, too, of the
roasted monkeys was similar to the odour of roasted
human beings&mdash;which I knew well, as I had on several
previous occasions been at rough cremations of people
in Japan, in the Himahlya (or Himalayas), and in
Africa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> all slept soundly that night, I taking good care to
fasten the canoe well, so that we should not find her

<p>We had a minimum temperature of 63&deg; F. on the
night of August 8th.</p>

<p>In the morning my men killed another big monkey,
with the most human face I have ever seen on a quadruman&mdash;just
like a negro's countenance. It came
very near us in its curiosity to see what we were doing,
and, though shot at several times, remained there
watching us, as it had never heard the report of a rifle
before. When it fell down it put its hand on the
wound across its chest and cried just like a child. I
moved away while my men banged it on the head to
finish it off.</p>

<p class="fsc">Author's Canoe being made to travel across the Forest.</p>
<hr />
<p>After a hearty breakfast on the part of my men&mdash;my
own being limited to a small box of sardines, some
twenty or thirty boxes still remaining in my supply of
provisions&mdash;we resumed our journey down the troublesome
rapid. We had to do that with ropes, Alcides,
with his extraordinary way of thinking, actually going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-221" id="Pg_2-221"></a>[<a href="./images/2-221.png">221</a>]</span>
to the trouble of shifting a big rock out of the water,
which took him the best part of an hour, rather than
let the canoe go round it&mdash;in absolutely placid waters
in that particular spot. I let him do it rather than
have a quarrel, as I firmly believed that in consequence
of the great hardships his brain had slightly lost its
balance.</p>

<p>After that, strong eddies were again experienced
at first, but, for some 3,000 m. beyond, the water looked
beautiful and as placid as possible. The river was now
flowing mostly in a northerly direction or with slight
deviations, chiefly to the east. We came to a most
wonderful island with a spur of lava on its southern
side, in the shape of a dome, and highly glazed. On
each side of that island was a waterfall of some beauty.
The eastern channel was only 20 m. wide, and the
water fell over a wall of rock some 12 ft. high. Where
this wall projected above the foaming water the shiny
black carbonized rock showed a number of small
grottoes in its horizontal strata, and a number of
funnels like volcanic vents. The north-westerly and
broader channel had three successive rapids, the central
one some 10&frac12; ft. high, with a terrific current rushing
over it, and awe-inspiring whirlpools between the successive
rapids.</p>

<p>We took the canoe down by the central channel,
and when we got to the higher step, shoved her along
until she overhung the fall&mdash;as we had done the previous
day&mdash;and then let her drop down with a bump.
It was a difficult job to hold her when once she had
dropped down, as the waves below were very high and
tossed her about in a merciless manner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-222" id="Pg_2-222"></a>[<a href="./images/2-222.png">222</a>]</span>
My men had by this time become a little more
amenable to reason, and in moments of suspense or
danger always awaited my orders.</p>

<p>Once more did we eventually pack in the canoe
what remained of the baggage; once more did we
start&mdash;that time across a large basin 1,200 m. broad,
with hills on the east side of us on the right bank. On
the right of us, on leaving the basin, we had a beautiful
island, 300 m. long&mdash;Ariadne Island&mdash;with a fine
sand-spit at its southern end, and gorgeous vegetation
upon it. Barring a few boxes of sardines, we had no
more provisions of any kind, as all the food had been
wasted, or lost in our various accidents.</p>

<p>When I look back upon that journey, I am amazed
to think how Providence did help us all along. That
day my men were clamouring for food, and were most
unpleasant, putting the entire blame upon me and not
upon their own lack of common-sense. They refused
to go on. We pulled up along some rocks, baking hot
from the sun, which simply roasted our naked feet
when we trod upon them.</p>

<p>Some of the men took to their rifles and said they
had had quite enough of exploring. The more we went
down that river the worse things seemed to get. They
would not go a metre farther. They claimed the
balance of their salaries at once&mdash;I always paid them
punctually every month&mdash;and said they would start on
foot and try to get somewhere, if God would help them.</p>

<p>I agreed to pay them their salaries and let them
go, taking a few minutes to distribute the money, as
I wished to go to a secluded spot, not caring to undo
the large packages of banknotes before them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-223" id="Pg_2-223"></a>[<a href="./images/2-223.png">223</a>]</span>
I was walking along the rocks, saying to my men
that I would be back in a few minutes, when a huge
<i>cachorra</i>, or dog-fish, weighing some thirty pounds,
leapt out of the water and fell on the rocks, wriggling
and bounding convulsively. I called the men, who
hastily arrived, and with the butts of their rifles killed
the fish. While they were busy dissecting it, Alcides,
who had not taken part in the quarrel, but had gone
to the forest some little way off, hearing the noise,
reappeared with a huge monkey he had killed.</p>

<p>I left the men to prepare an excellent and plentiful
meal while I retired to a distant spot to count out
their salaries. When I returned and handed them the
money&mdash;after their appetites had been fully satisfied,
and they had left next to nothing for me&mdash;they said
I could keep the money, as they did not want it;
they were sorry for what they had said, and would go
on wherever I ordered them to go. They said that I
certainly must have a guardian angel watching over
me, and they were sure that as long as they were in
my company they would never die of starvation.</p>

<p>"I have never seen anything like it!" exclaimed
the man X, who was the humorist of the party.
"We want food and cannot get it, and there <i>el senhor</i>
strolls a few yards away from us and a huge fish jumps
almost into his arms in order to be eaten."</p>

<p>I never cared to let them know of my own surprise
at the extraordinary occurrence.</p>

<p>I was rather pleased that day, because my men,
in an outburst of friendliness, said they knew that if
ever we did die of starvation it would not be my fault,
because had they been careful we would still have had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-224" id="Pg_2-224"></a>[<a href="./images/2-224.png">224</a>]</span>
three or four months' supply of provisions left. They
themselves said how foolish they had been; the provisions
we carried had only lasted us thirty days.
Nearly three weeks before I had warned Alcides to
economize, and the result was that, instead of sorting
out food twice a day to the men, he sorted it out four
times a day and in double quantities.</p>

<p class="fsc">Launching the Canoe after its Journey over a Hill Range.</p>
<hr />
<p>That day we were really in great luck. We had the
good fortune to find a <i>bacopari</i> tree simply laden with
delicious yellow fruit, not unlike unripe cherries, and
we absolutely feasted on them.</p>

<p>To show how unpractical my men were, it is sufficient
to tell that, unlike any other human beings on the
face of the globe when under a fruit-tree, they did
not proceed to shake the cherries down by throwing
sticks or by climbing up the tree. No, indeed;
but they cut down the huge tree, which required
about an hour and a half of very hard work. Anyhow,
we got the cherries, and that was the principal
thing.</p>

<p>We continued our journey over a small rapid with
a low hill range spreading from west to east on the
left bank. The river here was 300 m. wide. A hill
range from 100 to 200 ft. high was also to be seen on
the right bank, running parallel with that on the left.
Five or six kilometres farther another high range of a
gorgeous cobalt-blue colour and extending from south-west
to north-east, stood in front of us. The river in
that stretch was most beautiful, and was 900 m. wide.
A charming little island 300 m. long was reflected in
the water, which looked as still as oil in that particular
part, although it actually ran swiftly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-225" id="Pg_2-225"></a>[<a href="./images/2-225.png">225</a>]</span>
Although that scene was of great placidity, we believed
there was more danger ahead of us, for we could hear
in the distance the loud roar of another rapid or waterfall.
Judging by the noise we knew it must be a big
one. Soon afterwards we reached the rapid.</p>

<p>We had the greatest difficulty in approaching this,
owing to the strong current we encountered in a small
channel we followed near the right bank. The rapid
was 400 m. wide and 400 m. long, with a drop of from
4 to 5 ft. Although we expected trouble at that spot,
we shot the rapid with comparative ease, but we were
badly knocked about, and shipped a considerable
amount of water in the high waves thrown violently
against the rocks. We camped that night near the
rapid, having travelled in the day 26 kil. We made
our camp in the forest, and we experienced stifling
heat, the minimum temperature (August 9th) being
73&deg; F., with heavy rain which came down upon us
through the foliage in regular bucketfuls.</p>

<p>We had nothing to eat in the evening. In the
morning our breakfast consisted of two sardines each.
We went on in a half-hearted way, my men grumbling
all the time, and looking out for birds or monkeys.
Seven thousand five hundred metres from our camp
we came to a waterfall, where we had endless
trouble. The principal channel led to 50&deg; b.m., but
the river split up into innumerable channels among
islands, islets and rocks that formed a regular maze.
The river was in that particular spot 1,200 m. wide,
and contained great masses of volcanic rock, much
fissured, and having great holes in them. This mass
of rock extended from north-east to south-west.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-226" id="Pg_2-226"></a>[<a href="./images/2-226.png">226</a>]</span>
There were large cracks, where the mass had split,
and had subsequently been eroded by the rush of
water. The rock had cutting edges everywhere like
those of razors. With endless difficulty we had managed
to drag the canoe along nearly to the bottom of
that dangerous place, when we were suddenly confronted
by a drop of 12 ft. with a terrific rush of
water over it. It was impossible for us to negotiate
that point, for below was a whirlpool absolutely
impassable. We had therefore the tiresome work
of dragging back the canoe for some 350 m. up
the rapid once more, in order that we might find a
more suitable channel. To make things more lively
for us, a violent thunderstorm broke out, soaking all
our baggage but making little difference to us, as we
were soaked already. We had spent that entire day
in the water, struggling to take the canoe down the
rapid and up once more. By eight o'clock at night
we were still working, endeavouring to save the canoe.</p>

<p>We had had no lunch, and now had no dinner. My
men felt perfectly miserable, and in their speech did
not exactly bless the day they had started with me
on that expedition. We had worked hard, and had
only covered a distance of 7,500 m. in twelve hours.
At sunset, while the storm was raging, we beheld a
most wonderful effect of light to the west, very
much like a gorgeous aurora borealis. The sky, of
intense vermilion, was streaked with beautiful radiations
of the brightest lemon-yellow, which showed out
vividly against the heavy black clouds directly above
our heads. The river reflected the red tints, so that
we appeared to be working in a river of blood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-227" id="Pg_2-227"></a>[<a href="./images/2-227.png">227</a>]</span>
As we had nothing to eat, I thought I would spend
my time in taking the correct elevation of that place
with the boiling-point thermometers. The man X,
the humorist of the party, remarked that if I were
killed and went to Heaven or some other place, the
first thing I should do would be to take the exact
elevation with what he called "the little boiling
stove" (the hypsometrical apparatus).</p>

<p>We had a minimum temperature of 62&deg; F. during
the night of August 10th.</p>

<p>Next morning I sent my men to reconnoitre, in order
to see if they could get some edible fruit. As they
stayed away a long time I knew they had found something.
In fact, they came back quite in a good humour,
as they had found some <i>jacoba</i> or <i>jacuba</i> trees, with
abundant fruit on them, most delicious to eat.</p>

<p>In the meantime I had gone exploring the rapids endeavouring
to find a more suitable channel. Eventually,
on the east side of the stream, I found a place where
we could take the canoe down. There too was a
fall of 9 ft., down which we let the canoe with
considerable difficulty; then it had to pass over a
number of smaller terraces and down winding channels,
where we sweated for some hours before we got
through our work. Innumerable channels separated by
sand-mounds 20 to 30 ft. high had formed along that
rapid and also through the vertical wall of cutting
volcanic rock which formed a barrier across the stream.
Below the fall were two long sand-banks, one with
some <i>burity</i> palms upon it.</p>

<p>The river flowed 20&deg; west of north for some 4,000 m.
We had gone but 2,000 m. of that distance when we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-228" id="Pg_2-228"></a>[<a href="./images/2-228.png">228</a>]</span>
came to another rocky barrier, spreading from south-west
to north-east, on approaching which we heard the
thundering roaring of another rapid. On the left bank
we had a hill range all along. The noise of the rapid
got louder and louder, and we were soon confronted
by a terrifying rush of water at a spot where three
arms of the river met with such force that the
clashing waters shot up in the air, forming a wave
some 40 or 50 ft. high with a foaming crest. The
backwash from this great wave was so violent against
the rocky banks of the river&mdash;very narrow there&mdash;that
it was quite impossible for the canoe, even empty, to
be let down by means of ropes.</p>

<p>My men were in absolute despair, for the farther
we went the more insurmountable became the obstacles
which confronted us. They said they had agreed to
go on a journey of exploration, but surely I was taking
them direct to Hades&mdash;if we had not got there already.
I could not well contradict them, for certainly that
particular spot was the nearest possible approach to it.</p>

<p>It does not do ever to lose courage. While my men,
in the lowest state of depression, sat on the volcanic
rocks, I went about exploring on the right bank until
I found a place where the river had eroded a channel
but had afterwards filled it with an immense accumulation
of rocks. If we could only move those rocks away&mdash;several
hundreds of them&mdash;I saw that it would
be possible to push the canoe along the channel which
would thus be formed. The work would require a
great deal of hard labour.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Most Dangerous Rapid navigated by Author and his Men.</p>
<hr />
<p>You should have seen the faces of my men when I
took them to the spot and asked them to remove all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-229" id="Pg_2-229"></a>[<a href="./images/2-229.png">229</a>]</span>
the big boulders. In order to set them a good example,
I myself started moving the rocks about, the smaller
ones for preference. We worked and worked hour
after hour, jamming our fingers and feet all the
time as we pushed the rocks to one side and the
other of the little channel, only 4 ft. wide, which we
were making. The language of my men was pretty
enough, but as long as they worked I had to put up
with it. Alcides, who was really a great worker, and
whose principal fault was that he would never save
himself, worked with tremendous vigour that day. Somehow
or other the men seemed to think the work hard.</p>

<p>When we had taken the canoe safely to the end of
the rapid through the channel we had cleared, I went
back to the top of the rapid to gaze once more on the
wonderful sight where the two principal channels met.
The water dashed against a rock in the centre with
most impressive fury.</p>

<p>On returning to the bottom of the rapid where I
had left the canoe, another most impressive sight was
to be seen. In the vertiginous waters emerging from
the channel high waves&mdash;most unpleasant-looking and
in the greatest confusion&mdash;clashed against one another
for a distance of over 500 m. below the rapid.</p>

<p>My men would not camp that night near the rapid,
which they said was the devil's home, so during the
night we went 2 kil. down the stream, where, simply
worn out, we made our camp. We never could get
any fish from the stream now. We had gone only
6,000 m. that day. I reckoned that, travelling at
that rate, I should perhaps reach my goal, Manaos, in
five or six years' time&mdash;and all the provisions I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-230" id="Pg_2-230"></a>[<a href="./images/2-230.png">230</a>]</span>
left for seven men, all counted, were now eight tins of
sardines.</p>

<p>We had a minimum temperature of 64&deg; F. on the
night of August 11th.</p>

<p>We had halted just above another big and beautiful
waterfall, 20 ft. high, and of immense width.
The great rush of water curled over a gigantic dome
of volcanic rock with many big holes and fissures.
The waterfall was followed by a ghastly rapid 500 m.
long. It was impossible to go over the fall, and the
only way left us&mdash;a most dangerous one&mdash;was to let the
canoe down a small channel 50 to 80 m. wide, cut
among the vertical rocks on the right side of the waterfall.
The water in the channel flowed in steeply sloping
cascades. The channel twisted round abruptly in
two or three places, and in one spot went through a
rocky neck 35 m. wide, where the force of the current
was so great that I was really perplexed as to how
we could take the canoe down without getting her
smashed to atoms.</p>

<p>Providence came to my help again. In looking
round I discovered an ancient channel, now almost
dry and strewn with innumerable rocks, by which it
might be possible to take the canoe overland until we
could find a smooth place in the water below the rapid.
On further exploring that channel, as I was quick
enough in noticing its possibilities, I found at the end
of it what the Brazilians call a <i>recanto</i>&mdash;that is to say,
a backwater which the river had there formed, and
which would be a great help to us in floating the canoe
once more.</p>

<p>This plan involved a great deal of hard work, as not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-231" id="Pg_2-231"></a>[<a href="./images/2-231.png">231</a>]</span>
only had we to shift many large rocks out of their
position, but we had to construct a railway with felled
trees and rollers upon them. We could not get perfectly
horizontal rails, so that the effort of moving the
canoe along inch by inch with levers was trying,
especially as we had had insufficient food for many
days and our strength was fast failing.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, Alcides that day broke out
in revolt. He had, like many ignorant people, the misfortune
of believing that he knew everything better than
anybody else. I had given him instructions to place the
rails and rollers in a certain position, so that the canoe
could be shifted over some unpleasant rocks. He, however,
insisted on placing the rollers in the wrong place
and on using the levers in the wrong spots, so that
they not only did not act helpfully, but actually had
the contrary effect on the canoe from that which we
wanted to obtain. I remonstrated, and showed the
men once more how to do it. They agreed with me,
except Alcides, who became enraged to such an extent
that his eyes bulged out of their orbits in his fury.
He brandished one of the big levers in the air, and,
shouting at the top of his voice, proceeded to give a
long harangue stating that Araguary&mdash;his native town&mdash;produced
greater men than England or any other
country, and inciting the other men to open revolt
against me.</p>

<p>This was a serious affair and most unexpected, as
so far I had counted on Alcides to stand by me, no
matter what happened. The other men were undecided.
Although they were always ready to revolt,
they had more confidence in the brain of an English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-232" id="Pg_2-232"></a>[<a href="./images/2-232.png">232</a>]</span>man
than in that of an Araguary man. Alcides suggested
that they should take possession of the canoe
and everything, and that I should be left on the rocks.
He shouted to the men to take the canoe along, and
he himself pushed with all his might, the canoe not
budging the tenth part of an inch.</p>

<p>I sat down on a rock. I merely said that the canoe
would not move until I wished it to move. This
statement I made because I saw that in their stupidity
they had placed some pieces of wood under the canoe
which acted as wedges instead of rollers; one piece in
particular&mdash;a roller which had split in two&mdash;could not
possibly move along the rough wooden rails. The
men pushed and worked with all their might for over
three hours, the canoe remaining still like a solid rock.
At last they came to me and asked me to show them
how to move it. I placed the rollers where they would
be effective, removing the wedges which were impeding
her journey, and with very little effort the canoe moved
along.</p>

<p>With wild yells of excitement the men proclaimed
this a miracle, always excepting Alcides, who, with a
fierce expression on his face, stood now on one side,
fondling his rifle. The other men chaffed him, and
even insulted him, saying that he had made them
struggle for nothing, as he did not know what he was
about. When the rails and the rollers were placed
right the canoe slid along the distance which remained
to be covered, and eventually glided gracefully once
more into the water.</p>

<p class="fsc">Letting the Canoe jump a Rapid.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was too bad that Alcides&mdash;one of the bravest of
men&mdash;should possess such a mean mind and such an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-233" id="Pg_2-233"></a>[<a href="./images/2-233.png">233</a>]</span>
ungrateful nature. Twice I had saved his life when he
came within an ace of perishing in dangerous rapids,
but never had he given thanks to me&mdash;never had he
shown the slightest sign of recognition. Never, during
the entire time he was in my employ, did he&mdash;or
any of my other men&mdash;say "Good morning" to me
when we rose, or "Good night" when we retired to
sleep. Two or three nights before this last adventure,
during a heavy rainstorm, I had deprived myself
of my own tent in order to shelter him and the other
men, while I myself got drenched.</p>

<p>"He only does it," said he, "because he needs to
keep us alive to do the work, or else he would not
do it."</p>

<p>I only received offensive words for any kindnesses
I showered on him and the others.</p>

<p>It is seldom one could find a man with a more unpractical
mind. He spent most of his energy working
uselessly&mdash;and, mind you, very hard indeed&mdash;for nothing,
but he could never be made to apply his strength
in a sensible way. If I asked him to cut me a tooth-pick,
he would proceed to cut down one of the largest
trees in the neighbourhood and work for an hour or
two until he had reduced a big section of it into the
needed article. He wasted hours daily, and ruined all
our axes and cutlery into the bargain, in scraping flat
surfaces on rocks and on the hardest trees, on which he
subsequently engraved his name and that of his lady-love
whom he had left behind. He was really marvellous
at calligraphy, and could certainly write the
best hand of any man I have ever known.</p>

<p>He quarrelled all the time with all the other men,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-234" id="Pg_2-234"></a>[<a href="./images/2-234.png">234</a>]</span>
and to enforce his words was constantly producing his
automatic pistol fully loaded or else his rifle.</p>

<p>When I first employed him I had the misfortune to
send him on some messages to two or three people,
with the result that those former friends became my
bitterest enemies, as he had insulted them. He
was one of the men who cannot open their mouths
without offending. Wasteful to an incredible degree,
his only ambition was to show how much he could
spend&mdash;especially when he was spending other people's
money&mdash;a most trying thing for me when we were,
months before, near any shop. When you mentioned
anything to him he immediately said that it
was impossible to do it, no matter how simple the
matter was. He spent hours looking at himself in a
small pocket mirror he carried on his person, and
would grumble for long hours over the stings of
mosquitoes and gnats which had dared to spoil his
features. He used violent language against the impudent
rocks which had injured his feet.</p>

<p>His brutality to men and beasts alike was most
hurtful to me. He once abandoned his favourite dog
on an island, simply because he had kicked it viciously
the day before and the dog would not respond to his
calls and enter the canoe. He now proposed to kill
the other dogs, as he said they had finished their work
as watch-dogs, since we never came across any Indians,
and it was no use taking them along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brazilians</span> of a low class are unfortunately easily led
by words. Alcides, who could not get over his bad
temper, once more incited the men to revolt. While
I was busy taking altitude observations with the
hypsometrical apparatus I kept my eye on them, as I
saw plainly that I was coming in for trouble.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us another bad part of the rapid
had to be negotiated, and the only way possible was
to take the canoe overland once more. With Alcides
at their head, all the men were now in open rebellion,
and absolutely refused to work.</p>

<p>"Very good," I said to them. "If you do not like
to take the canoe along we shall stay here. I like this
spot very much, as it is most picturesque."</p>

<p>The men filled the magazines of their rifles with
cartridges, and then came threateningly toward me,
shoving the muzzles right in my face.</p>

<p>"You must give us food," said they. "We want
to eat, and we want to be taken back to our country."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-236" id="Pg_2-236"></a>[<a href="./images/2-236.png">236</a>]</span>
I advised them to take a walk in the forest
and see if they could shoot something there, for
if they shot me, one fact was certain, and that
was that they would never see their happy homes
again.</p>

<p>Two of the men turned away in order to go after
game, but the man X levelled his rifle at my head
and demanded his money, as he wished to leave at
once. The contract I had with him was different from
that I had with the other men. I had agreed to pay
him on reaching the nearest point of civilization,
where I would let him loose again. I therefore said
that I would most certainly pay him the very minute
he had fulfilled his contract.</p>

<p>I paid no more attention to his threat, although I
heard the click of the hammer of his rifle being cocked.
I told him to get some wood to make a fire, as I wished
to make myself a cup of chocolate.</p>

<p>In unpacking some of my instruments I had made a
great discovery&mdash;a box of chocolate, which had strayed
into a package by mistake.</p>

<p>X seemed undecided whether to shoot or not. I
made no attempt to take the rifle out of his hand, as
that would have been fatal. After a few moments he
sat down on a rock a few yards away, his rifle resting
on his knees and pointing in my direction, while I
myself collected some small pieces of wood and proceeded
to make the fire.</p>

<p class="fsc">Artificial Canal made by Author and his Men in order to take their Canoe along where the river was Impassable.</p>
<hr />
<p>Filippe the negro, who had his eye on the box of
chocolate, came and helped to blow the flame. We got
some water and boiled it in a large tin cup. While we
were doing that I heard rifles being fired in the forest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-237" id="Pg_2-237"></a>[<a href="./images/2-237.png">237</a>]</span>
and presently Antonio returned with some fine <i>jacu</i>
(<i>Penelope cristata</i>) he had shot.</p>

<p>The entire morning of August 12th was absolutely
wasted, owing to the conduct of my men. Even after
they had had a good meal, not a particle of which they
offered me&mdash;not that I asked them for it&mdash;they were
still in a riotous mood.</p>

<p>As was my habit when I had anything to eat, I
always shared it in equal parts with them: when the
chocolate was ready&mdash;notwithstanding their behaviour&mdash;I
asked them for their cups, and each one received
his share of that delicious beverage. As usual also, I
sorted out that day the customary allowance of tobacco
to each man, which I had been fortunate enough to
save in our accidents.</p>

<p>When I offered the chocolate to Alcides, he handed
his cup to Filippe to bring to me, and when it was
handed back to him he flung it away saying he would
prefer to die rather than drink the filthy English stuff.</p>

<p>Matters were a little critical. A great number of
rollers were required and a number of wooden rails.
Curiously enough, the man X, who had been the most
violent that day, was the only one who came to thank
me for the chocolate, and offered to work, the others
all refusing to move.</p>

<p>He and I cut down three or four trees, when the
other men&mdash;ashamed of themselves&mdash;took the axes
and proceeded to work also. But instead of cutting
down trees which were straight they cut down the
knottiest trees they could find, and made rollers which
were absolutely useless. It was their silly way of wasting
the little energy they had left. The result was that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-238" id="Pg_2-238"></a>[<a href="./images/2-238.png">238</a>]</span>
they had to do the work over again and cut other trees
and other rollers.</p>

<p>Eventually we succeeded in pushing the canoe over
the rocks until we were some 20 m. from the water
again. With some effort we succeeded in shoving her
along 18 m. out of those 20 m. There only remained
the last 2 m.&mdash;unfortunately uphill, which made our
effort a little greater. Here the men again stopped
work and refused to give that last push to get the
canoe over those rocks and then into the water. Once
more they said they would shoot me and then proceed
through the forest on foot.</p>

<p>Matters looked bad indeed. Those 2 m., with a
sharp angle upward, made an insurmountable obstacle
which I could not negotiate alone. With the corner
of my eye I saw the rifles of my men levelled at me.
There was only one way out of that difficulty&mdash;to give
my men a little excitement.</p>

<p>"Very good!" I said to them. "If we have not
the strength to move the canoe over those rocks, we
certainly have the courage to shoot the rapid." I said
I had never yet known a Brazilian who failed when it
came to courage, and I was sure they would not fail,
as I had already seen how brave they had been.</p>

<p>Flattery always answers.</p>

<p>"Come along, boys! We will take the canoe back
into the rapid."</p>

<p>In a moment they had deposited their rifles on the
rocks and they were all helping me to push the canoe
back the way we had come.</p>

<p>The rapid in that particular part was devilish&mdash;not
unlike the narrow channel we had gone through some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-239" id="Pg_2-239"></a>[<a href="./images/2-239.png">239</a>]</span>
time before. The passage, with high rocks on either
side, was tortuous, and threw the water with great force
from one side to the other, producing high waves in
the centre in such confusion that it was quite terrifying
to look at them.</p>

<p>When my men looked at those awful waters, they
suggested that perhaps we had better let the canoe
down with ropes. I had quite made up my mind that
we should lose the canoe for certain in that spot; and
had we gone down in her ourselves we should undoubtedly
have lost our lives as well.</p>

<p>When we started taking her down with ropes&mdash;our
ropes were all rotted by that time, and had no strength
whatever&mdash;the canoe was tossed about in a merciless
manner. I recommended my men as they ran along
to beware of the ropes catching on the cutting edges
of the high rocks. No sooner had the canoe started
down the swift current than one of the ropes at
once caught on a rock and snapped. The men who
held the other rope were unable to hold it, and let it
go. I saw the canoe give three or four leaps in the
centre of the channel and then disappear altogether.
That was a sad moment for me. But as my eye
roamed along the foaming waters, what was my surprise
when I saw the canoe shoot out of the water in
a vertical position at the end of the rapid and waterfall!
That was the greatest piece of luck I had on
that journey. By being flung out of the water with
such force she naturally emptied herself of all the
water she contained, and I next saw her floating, going
round and round the whirlpool at the bottom of the
rapid.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-240" id="Pg_2-240"></a>[<a href="./images/2-240.png">240</a>]</span>
The next problem was how to recover the canoe,
as she happened to be on the opposite side of the
stream. There for more than two hours we watched
her going round and round, while we sat on the rocks,
absolutely speechless. Eventually we saw her gradually
come out of the whirlpool and drift slowly in the
<i>recanto</i> or backwater on the opposite shore some 400 m.
away, revolving slowly around herself.</p>

<p>My men were perplexed. They now said they
would all leave me at once and proceed on foot. Under
no circumstances whatever would they accompany me
any more. They must have their pay and go.</p>

<p>So after a few minutes I paid the salaries of all
the men, excepting the man X. To my surprise the
men, instead of going, remained seated a little way
off.</p>

<p>I had a plan in my head of swimming across the
river below the whirlpool, where the water was placid
although of great width, but I could not very well
place myself in such an awkward position as to leave
on the river bank the large sums of money which I
carried on my person. I certainly could not swim across
such a long distance, and in such a current, with the
heavy bags of coin and banknotes round my waist. I
feared&mdash;in fact, felt certain&mdash;that in the mood in which
my men were that day, the moment I entered the
water and was quite helpless they would fire at me
and get away with everything I possessed. I knew
that they would never dare to do it unless they could
catch me in a helpless condition.</p>

<p class="fsc">Rapid through which Author took his Canoe.</p>
<hr />
<p>I called Antonio&mdash;who was an excellent swimmer&mdash;and
said that I offered a reward of &pound;10 to any men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-241" id="Pg_2-241"></a>[<a href="./images/2-241.png">241</a>]</span>
who swam across and recovered the canoe. Antonio
reflected deeply for some time, then consented to go
if another man went with him. For nearly an hour
he confabulated with Filippe the white man, who was
also a splendid swimmer. It was with some relief that
I saw the two eventually enter the water, after a
paddle had been tied with long strings round each of
their waists in order that they might be able to bring
the canoe back.</p>

<p>At the point where they started the river was
200 m. wide. Although seemingly placid the current
was strong. They drifted down some 300 m.&mdash;I with
my telescope keeping a sharp watch on the canoe,
which was still going round and round, and was now
once more almost entirely filled with water. No sooner
had the men, quite exhausted, reached the opposite
bank than the canoe, which had been in that spot for
some hours, for some reason or other started out and
proceeded to float down stream in the very centre of
the river. Filippe the negro and I at once started on
a chase on our side of the water, in case she came near
enough to seize her. I shouted and signalled to the
men on the opposite bank to swim across once more to
try and catch her in mid-stream.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, after a chase of several
kilometres, over cutting rocks and great banks of sand
in which we sank up to our knees&mdash;while the naked
men with their paddles ran as fast as they could on
the opposite bank&mdash;the canoe drifted close to the other
bank once more, and the men were able to board her.
It was a great relief to me when at last the canoe was
brought over to our side and we towed her back so as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-242" id="Pg_2-242"></a>[<a href="./images/2-242.png">242</a>]</span>
to get the baggage on board and proceed on our
journey.</p>

<p>Each of the two men who had rescued the canoe at
once received the reward I had offered, and Filippe the
negro, who had shown willingness in recovering the
boat, also received a handsome present.</p>

<p>The entire day of August 12th had been spent in
going those few hundred metres of the rapid. Our
camp that evening was but 400 m. from that of the
day before.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature of August 12th had been
70&deg; F., whereas during the night of August 13th it
was 62&deg; F.</p>

<p>That little adventure had pulled the men together
somewhat. I spoke in great praise of the courage that
Antonio and Filippe had shown in swimming across the
stream.</p>

<p>The river was smooth for a little distance, when
we proceeded once more with our navigation; but
soon it became narrow&mdash;only 40 to 50 m. wide&mdash;with
strong eddies in its deep channel between rocky sides.
Some magnificent sand beaches 15 to 20 ft. high were
observed, particularly on the right bank, not far from
a tributary 3 m. wide which entered the main river
on the left side. Lower down, the river described a
sharp turn, and there we met another most dangerous
rapid. It was entered by a passage 50 m. wide, after
which a circular basin of rock&mdash;evidently an ancient
crater&mdash;100 m. in diameter appeared; then the water
flowed out with terrific force by a channel only 30 m.
wide. The stream produced prodigious eddies in the
circular basin. Waves of great height were dashed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-243" id="Pg_2-243"></a>[<a href="./images/2-243.png">243</a>]</span>
to and fro from one side to the other of the narrow
channel, between high rocks on either side. The
water flowed first in a direction E.S.E. for 500 m.,
then turned off suddenly to due east for a distance
of 400 m. That spot was most difficult for us to go
through.</p>

<p>Soon after, the river turned due north and broadened
to a width of 120 m. for some 4,000 m. A great basin
was crossed, with submerged rocks, forming counter
currents of great power and most unpleasant whirlpools.
I observed with some concern a stupendous vortex
30 m. in diameter and with a deep central depression.
The water revolved with such velocity and force that
it formed a series of high-crested white waves running
one after another at a terrifying speed around its
periphery. The water was raised around the vortex
certainly 10 or 12 ft. above the level of the river&mdash;owing
to the opposition between the rotating water
and the current. We gave that vortex as wide a berth
as we could; it really frightened one to be near it,
although there was no particular danger unless we
got right into it.</p>

<p>A charming island was passed soon after, on which,
as well as on the left bank, were innumerable rubber
trees, but there were none on the right, where <i>chapada</i>
was to be seen.</p>

<p>We had in front of us a hill range 300 ft. high.
As we went farther we were in a channel between high
rocks strewn about along both banks in fragments of
great size; then we were once again in a circular
basin with high vertical rocks&mdash;perhaps another extinct
crater. We were here in a region of volcanic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-244" id="Pg_2-244"></a>[<a href="./images/2-244.png">244</a>]</span>
formation. No sooner had we passed this basin than
we came upon another bad rapid, 400 m. long, which
divided itself into two channels, after going through a
narrow passage not more than 30 m. wide, where we got
tossed about in a most alarming manner, being once or
twice nearly dashed to pieces against the rocky sides.
We had had so much trouble with the rapids that
day that by sunset we had only gone 19 kil. 600 m.
Since we had come to that volcanic region we had
found rocks with great holes in which stagnant water
lay. Myriads of insects&mdash;regular clouds of them&mdash;worried
us nearly to death.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-244.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-244_th.jpg" alt="Conveying the Canoe by Hand down a Rapid." title="Conveying the Canoe by Hand down a Rapid." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Conveying the Canoe by Hand down a Rapid.</p>
<hr />
<p>On August 14th we started early, the minimum
temperature having been 70&deg; F. during the night. After
leaving the rapid we came to a great basin 1,000 m.
across. A most beautiful sand beach 300 m. long was
to be seen on the left side, below a vertical cliff of great
beauty, 200 ft. high. Another great sand beach was
to be seen on the right of the river, where it described
a sharp turn to 30&deg; b.m. Then the river dashed
through a passage of rocks only 80 m. broad, and
emerged once more into another great basin with
many indentations in its rocky coast.</p>

<p>Some 6 kil. beyond, another basin was found, with
more rocks strewn on and near its eastern bank, and
a number of rocky islets. A high hill range with
vertical cliffs stood on the west side and ended abruptly
at the end of the basin. Low hills ran all along the
river on the left side.</p>

<p>The river had an average width here of 250 m.,
and flowed mostly in directions between north-west
and north-east.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-245" id="Pg_2-245"></a>[<a href="./images/2-245.png">245</a>]</span>
We went down all the time on troubled waters, with
rocky banks and innumerable obstacles all the way.
We went through another terrible and most intricate
rapid&mdash;the Labyrinth&mdash;and passed through a channel
only 40 m. wide between high rocky banks. Then, after
that, for 9,500 m. we had fair and smooth navigation,
with a range of flat-topped hills 300 ft. high, extending
from W.S.W. to E.N.E., in front of us to the north-west.
Here there was a regular maze of channels, all
more or less bad. We did not follow the principal
one, which was strewn with rocks, but a smaller one, at
the end of which, unfortunately, we found a barrier
of rocks which we could not surmount. We had
all the trouble of dragging the canoe back up the
rapid until we could turn her round into another
channel.</p>

<p>We arrived at the waterfall of S. Sim&atilde;o, where we
went through numerous channels, following the right
bank as much as we could, until we arrived at a gigantic
staircase of rock, down which the water divided itself
into little channels. We took all the baggage over the
rocks on the right bank&mdash;a very heavy task, as we had
to climb up and down big boulders with sharp edges.
We slipped many times with the loads we were carrying,
and many, indeed, were the patches of skin we
left behind in that particular place. We had a great
deal of trouble in finding a place where we could take
the canoe down. Eventually we had to go right across
the stream over the waterfall and land on an island of
rock in the centre of the river, where I had seen with
my telescope that we might perhaps find a suitable
passage for the canoe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-246" id="Pg_2-246"></a>[<a href="./images/2-246.png">246</a>]</span>
Crossing the river diagonally just above the fall
was risky work, and although we described a big arc
up the stream, we only just managed to make the
island before we were borne down by the current.</p>

<p>The horseshoe-shaped waterfall was about 300 m.
across and some 30 ft. high. When the river is full it
must be beautiful, for the east side, which was then
absolutely dry, is covered entirely by water, which
must form a wonderful series of cascades. When the
river is in flood, the waterfall, extending from north-west
to south-east, has a total width of 1,000 m.
There were some picturesque bits of rugged foliated
rock over that great staircase, and huge cracks through
which the water gurgled and foamed&mdash;those fissures
formed not by the erosion of water but by volcanic
action, perhaps by an earthquake. The large fall to
the north-west, over which the water flows in every
season, had on one side of it a steep incline, down
which we took the canoe until we came to a drop about
15 ft. high.</p>

<p>We halted for the night just above that high drop,
spending a most miserable night, being simply devoured
by insects. The minimum temperature during
the night of August 15th was 72&deg; F.</p>

<p>My men were in a beastly temper in the morning,
when we had to proceed, as on previous occasions, to
make an artificial channel by moving innumerable
boulders of all sizes. It was a heavy task, for we
hardly had any strength left, our meals having been
most irregular of late.</p>

<p>A channel was not so easily made in that particular
spot, as there were some boulders which we could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-247" id="Pg_2-247"></a>[<a href="./images/2-247.png">247</a>]</span>
possibly move, and the canoe must be made to go
over them.</p>

<p>We had only been working for a few minutes, when
again there was a riot among my men; again they
took to their rifles and said they would leave me and
the canoe there. Worse luck, the canoe got stuck hard
on a rock, and the men could not move her. I cut
down some rollers and some levers of the hardest woods
I could find in the forest near there, and when once I
had set to work a little more intelligently than they
did, I had no difficulty in moving the canoe along.
Eventually, with my men swearing at me the whole
time, the canoe was safely at the foot of the waterfall.</p>

<p>We were in great luck that day, for we found plenty
of wild fruit&mdash;very nutritious&mdash;and we killed one or
two large birds. My men grumbled all the time, saying
that they were dying of starvation, no meal being a
meal at all in Brazil unless accompanied by a small
mountain of <i>feij&atilde;o</i> (black beans). I had a few boxes
of sardines left, but I reserved those for extreme
occasions which might yet come.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the fall was an immense basin,
1,200 m. wide and 3,000 m. long from north to south.
The temperature was stifling that day&mdash;96&deg; F. in the
shade, and the sky overladen with clouds.</p>

<p>Fourteen kilometres by river below the S. Sim&atilde;o
came another waterfall, that of All Saints.</p>

<p>Observations with the hypsometrical apparatus
gave an elevation of 772 ft. above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>We halted above the rapid on a beautiful beach.
A curious thing happened. Antonio in jumping into
the water out of the canoe felt something sharp under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-248" id="Pg_2-248"></a>[<a href="./images/2-248.png">248</a>]</span>
his foot. In looking down he saw a magnificent sword.
On taking it out of the water we found that it was
an old sword of the time of the Emperor Pedro II.
A fight must have taken place there between a
Brazilian expedition and the Mundurucu Indians, who
at that time were to be found, I believe, in that region.
Presumably the expedition had been attacked at that
spot while trying to land. The sword was in excellent
preservation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had a minimum temperature on the night of
August 15th of 70&deg; F.</p>

<p>We descended the All Saints rapid and fall, 150 m.
in length, with no great difficulty, although with a
certain amount of hard work.</p>

<p>A large basin was below it, in the eastern part of
which was a charming island. Innumerable rubber
trees (<i>Siphonia elastica</i>) were to be seen in that region.
We found the south-east passage the best in descending
that rapid; but, although comparatively easy, we
had to use the greatest care, as my canoe was by now
falling to pieces, and a hard knock against a rock
would be fatal.</p>

<p>At the eastern end of the basin was a narrow
channel between high rocks, where the current was extremely
strong. A cluster of high vertical columnar
rocks was seen. The three channels into which the
river had been divided joined again in that basin, and
were forced through a passage between high vertical
rocky walls not more than 35 m. apart.</p>

<p>The water naturally was much troubled in being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-250" id="Pg_2-250"></a>[<a href="./images/2-250.png">250</a>]</span>
forced from different sides through that narrow passage,
and I knew that there must be danger. We
pulled up the canoe along some rocks 50 or 60 m. from
the entrance of the channel, and I instructed two men
to land and go and explore, to see what was in the
channel. The top rocks in that particular spot formed
innumerable little points, quite sharp, and it was
painful to walk on them with bare feet.</p>

<p>Antonio and white Filippe, who had been instructed
to go and reconnoitre, went a short distance away,
where they sat themselves down behind some rocks,
comfortably smoking cigarettes. After twenty minutes
or so they returned and said they had gone all along
the channel, and there was absolutely smooth water
and no danger whatever. I was not well satisfied with
their answer, but they swore they had inspected the
channel thoroughly, and there was no danger. So I
ordered them to enter the boat once more, and we
started off.</p>

<p>No sooner had we turned the corner round the high
rocky cliffs and entered the narrow gorge than we
were confronted by a huge central wave some 40 ft.
high in the channel. It was formed by the clashing
waters, coming from three different directions, meeting
at that spot and trying to push through simultaneously.
Before we knew where we were the canoe actually flew
up in the air, in an almost vertical position, to the top
of that enormous wave.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-250.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-250_th.jpg" alt="A Moment of Suspense." title="A Moment of Suspense." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">A Moment of Suspense.</p>
<p class="figcenter">Author and his men in their canoe going through a narrow channel between vertical walls of rock. The water forced through from three large arms of the river joining at that point formed a high and dangerous central wave.</p>
<hr />
<p>Baggage, men, and dogs slid down in confusion,
the canoe gliding back into the water and progressing
as swift as an arrow down the channel. The next
moment we were on the point of being dashed against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-251" id="Pg_2-251"></a>[<a href="./images/2-251.png">251</a>]</span>
the high rocky cliff on our right. To my amazement,
and just as I was expecting the impact, the canoe only
gracefully shaved the rock, the backwash which took
place along the rocks shifting us once more toward the
middle of the stream.</p>

<p>Once again the great rush of water shot us up in
the air, above the central wave, and this time the
canoe bucked and rode down on the other side of that
foaming mass of water.</p>

<p>My men were terrified. "Rema! rema! (Row!
row!) for Heaven's sake!" I shouted to the perplexed
men, as I tried to instil into them a little courage,
when within me I really thought we were lost. As I
shouted those words I saw to my horror two of the
paddles washed away, and as I quickly measured with
my eye the length of the channel I perceived that we still
had some 200 m. more of that kind of navigation before
we should shoot out of that dangerous place.</p>

<p>Up and down we went several times on that high
central wave; several times did we again shave the
rocks on either side of the narrow channel. We were
quite helpless, my men in chorus yelling "We are
lost! we are lost!"</p>

<p>Alcides bravely stuck to the helm for some time,
but the force of the water was so great that he was
knocked down into the canoe and had to let go. When
we reached the point where the narrow passage came
to an end, the waters looked so diabolical that when
my men shouted "We are lost! we are lost!" I could
not help saying "Yes, we are!"</p>

<p>I held on to the canoe desperately, as we were
banged about for a few seconds in a way that nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-252" id="Pg_2-252"></a>[<a href="./images/2-252.png">252</a>]</span>
stunned us, the waves striking me in the face with such
force that it took me some moments to recover. When
I did I found that we were already out of the channel
and in the whirlpool, the canoe full of water but
fortunately saved.</p>

<p>I lose most things in the world, but I never lose
my patience nor my sense of humour. I could not
help laughing when I looked at the expression on the
faces of my dogs&mdash;an expression of terror and astonishment,
as they looked first at the place from which we
had emerged and then at me, which I am sure would
have meant in words: "Good gracious! where in the
world are you taking us?"</p>

<p>We had to halt as soon as convenient in order to
cut some new paddles. It took my men some hours
to recover from the effects of that experience.</p>

<p>As is generally the case after a violent emotion, a
great deal of merriment was produced, my men for the
rest of the day talking about the incident and reproducing
in a realistic way the sounds of the rushing
water and the impact of the waves against the canoe.</p>

<p>We found after that a great basin 3,000 m. long,
1,300 m. broad, from west to east, with a lovely sand
beach 1,000 m. long on its eastern side.</p>

<p class="fsc">Conveying the Canoe through the Forest.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(Notice the side of the canoe split and stuffed with pieces of cloth.)</p>
<hr />
<p>At last&mdash;after all that time without meeting a soul&mdash;I
came across a small tribe of Mundurucus&mdash;six of
them all counted. They had their <i>aldeja</i>, or village,
on the right side of the stream. Their chief rejoiced
in the name of Jo&atilde;o. They were tiny little fellows,
the tallest only 5 ft. in height. If you had met them
anywhere else than in Central Brazil you would have
mistaken them for Japanese, so exactly like them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-253" id="Pg_2-253"></a>[<a href="./images/2-253.png">253</a>]</span>
were they in appearance. Their faces were of a very
dark yellow, almost black, with perfectly straight hair,
just like the Japanese or their near cousins, the Tagalos
of the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>The Mundurucus were mild and gentle, soft-spoken
and shy. They had all adopted Brazilian clothes.
The hut of the chief was extremely clean and neat
inside, the few utensils that were visible being kept in
a tidy manner.</p>

<p>Jo&atilde;o spoke a little Portuguese. From him I was
able to buy a quantity of <i>farinha</i>, which came in useful
to us, although I had to pay an exorbitant price for it&mdash;&pound;4
sterling for each 50 litres or thereabouts&mdash;that is
to say, about 5&frac12; pecks in English measure. The price
of <i>farinha</i> on the coast would be less than four shillings
for that quantity.</p>

<p>What interested me most among the Mundurucus
was their strange ornamentations. The angular pattern
was a great favourite with them, especially angles
side by side, and the cross&mdash;which I think had been
suggested, however, by their contact with Catholic
missionaries farther down the river.</p>

<p>The rudimentary figures which they carved&mdash;merely
lines for the body, legs and arms, and a dot for the head&mdash;were
extraordinary because they represented the
body and limbs covered with hair, done simply by
minor parallel lines. I asked the Mundurucus why
they represented human beings with hair, whereas they
themselves were hairless on the body and face. They
said it was because in ancient times all the people were
hairy like monkeys.</p>

<p>I was strongly impressed by the difference in type<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-254" id="Pg_2-254"></a>[<a href="./images/2-254.png">254</a>]</span>
between those Indians and the Bororos, and also by
the great difference in their language. When later on
I came in contact with the Apiacars, another tribe of
Indians living on the Tapajoz River, and closely allied
to the Mundurucus, I discovered that their language
bore a certain resemblance, curiously enough, to that
of the Maya Indians of Yucatan in Central America.</p>

<p>I had been so busy taking notes of all I had seen
in the <i>aldeja</i>, that when we started once more down the
river I did not at first miss my best dog, Negrino, of
whom I had got very fond. We had gone some 4 or
5 kil. down the river when I discovered that my men
had given it away to the Indians while I was occupied
studying the geological formation of that part of the
country. It was impossible to go back all those kilometres
against the current to recover the poor dog.
Although it gave me a great deal of pain I never for
one moment let the men see it, as I knew that it was
in order to hurt me that they had disposed of Negrino.</p>

<p>It is never right or useful to take revenge, for
if you wait long enough you are always avenged by
Providence. That afternoon my men saw some wild
chestnuts on a tree, and they insisted on landing to
pick them. They knocked down the tree, as usual, to
get the chestnuts, although it was fully 3 ft. in diameter.
They picked a great many of the wild chestnuts
and proceeded to eat them&mdash;Alcides, much to
my amazement, actually offering me one. I asked
them if they knew what they were eating, as I quickly
observed when the tree fell down that not a single
chestnut had been touched by birds or monkeys.</p>

<p>I have always noticed in equatorial countries that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-255" id="Pg_2-255"></a>[<a href="./images/2-255.png">255</a>]</span>
if you never touch fruit that monkeys do not eat you
will seldom get poisoned. My men said that they had
never seen the fruit before, but as it looked pretty they
were going to eat it, and a lot of it. So they stopped
some time cracking the nuts and eating them with
great delight.</p>

<p>When we got back to the canoe we had only gone
a short distance when Filippe the negro was seized
with violent pains in his inside. His eyes had become
sunken, his lips were quivering, and in a moment he
was seized with cramps all over the body&mdash;so much
so that he collapsed.</p>

<p>We had to halt on a small island of rock, where we
took Filippe out and I had him laid flat on his chest,
he being just like a corpse. I inserted a leather strap
into his throat in order to cause immediate vomiting,
then I unpacked some of the castor oil which still remained
in my possession&mdash;we never seemed to lose the
beastly stuff&mdash;and gave him a dose powerful enough
to kill an ox.</p>

<p>The other men were laughing all the time, saying
that they felt no pain at all; but their boast did not
last long, for a few moments later, while I was watching
poor Filippe, Antonio and the man X threw themselves
down on the rocks, rolling over and contorting
themselves, evidently in most excruciating pain.</p>

<p>The same treatment was applied to them in turn,
and I watched with great concern three men out of
the six spread out helpless, and in such a dreadful
condition that I really doubted whether they would be
alive in another hour. I considered myself fortunate
that the other three had not been poisoned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-256" id="Pg_2-256"></a>[<a href="./images/2-256.png">256</a>]</span>
Half an hour later&mdash;it was impossible to move on
with the three men lying helpless on the rocks&mdash;Filippe
the white man and Benedicto also collapsed.
Again the same treatment once more.</p>

<p>Alcides looked at the other men with an air of
contempt and said: "They are rotten fellows! They
cannot eat anything without getting poisoned. I feel
no pain at all; the fruit has done me no harm."</p>

<p>When I turned round to look at his face it had
turned a lemon-yellow colour, which I did not quite
like, but I did not mention the fact to him, and went
about from one dejected man to another to try and
bring them back to life again.</p>

<p>Filippe the negro opened his eyes for a moment.
"I am dying!" he said. "Good-bye, sir! Please
give all my money to my sweetheart in Araguary."</p>

<p>I noted her name and address in my book, for I
really thought Filippe was about to expire.</p>

<p>The moans and groans all round me were most
funereal, and the odour unbearable, the nuts having
formed a chemical combination in their insides which
made their breath most offensive. The heat in the sun
was oppressive on those volcanic rocks. My bare feet
were absolutely scorched as I walked on them.</p>

<p>Not many minutes later Alcides was rolling himself
upon the rocks in intense pain. When I rushed
to him to apply my favourite method he rebelled,
refusing the treatment.</p>

<p>"Very good," I said to him; "will you live or
will you die?"</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-256.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-256_th.jpg" alt="Leading the Empty Canoe down a Dangerous Channel." title="Leading the Empty Canoe down a Dangerous Channel." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Leading the Empty Canoe down a Dangerous Channel.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(Photographed a few seconds before the rope snapped and canoe escaped.)</p>
<hr />
<p>"I prefer to die," said he, and proceeded to moan
and groan, and also to dictate the name and address<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-257" id="Pg_2-257"></a>[<a href="./images/2-257.png">257</a>]</span>
of his sweetheart in Araguary for me to pay to her the
money which belonged to him.</p>

<p>In a way I was sorry to see my men suffering so
much. I was already thinking of how I could get out
of that difficult dilemma. If they had all died it
would have been out of the question for me to work
the huge canoe alone going down such dangerous rapids.</p>

<p>Some four hours were spent in deepest reflection,
a little distance off from my men. I had done my best,
and I could do no more for them. I returned every
little while to see how they were progressing, but for
the first three hours they were in so pitiful a condition
that I really thought they could not possibly recover.</p>

<p>When Alcides was almost unconscious I applied to
him also the remedy I had used for the other men.</p>

<p>It was only after some five hours or so that Filippe
the negro began to feel a little better. Gradually one
after another the men, half-dazed, were able to get
up, swaying about as if badly intoxicated. They said
they saw all the things in front of them moving up and
down. Evidently the poison had affected their vision
and also their hearing, as they said they could only
hear me faintly when I spoke to them.</p>

<p>Late in the evening I persuaded them to get once
more into the canoe, as it was not possible to camp
on those rocks. We floated down&mdash;fortunately for us
the river was placid for some 15 kil., and we let the
current do most of the work&mdash;I steering while all my
men lay flat in the bottom of the canoe. We passed
along two or three beautiful islands with quantities of
rubber upon them.</p>

<p>My men felt very bad the entire night, but by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-258" id="Pg_2-258"></a>[<a href="./images/2-258.png">258</a>]</span>
next morning they were a little better, although in a
most exhausted condition. We had a minimum temperature
of 72&deg; F. during the night of August 17th.</p>

<p>We had some luck that evening, for we came to the
hut of a <i>seringueiro</i>, a negro, and his wife, who had cut
down a portion of the forest near their hut and cultivated
some <i>mandioca</i>. Their amazement at seeing us
appear was curious to watch, especially when they
looked at our canoe&mdash;held together with pieces of rope
and stopped up with pieces of our garments.</p>

<p>Those poor people, stranded there without a possibility
of getting away, were extremely kind. My men
heard with delight that we should find no rapids of
great importance from that point down stream, and
that we might find a few other <i>seringueiros</i> on our way.</p>

<p>I was able to buy from the <i>seringueiro</i> a quantity
of food, my men being overjoyed at the prospect of
eating <i>feij&atilde;o</i> again with their meals. Naturally the expense
of taking food so far up the river was very great,
and I was glad indeed to pay the exorbitant price
which the <i>seringueiro</i> asked of &pound;10 sterling for each
50 kilos of <i>farinha</i>; <i>feij&atilde;o</i> at 6<i>s.</i> a pound; sugar at 5<i>s.</i>
a pound&mdash;the prices which the <i>seringueiros</i> themselves
had to pay for those commodities from the rare
trading boats which once a year reached that farthermost
point.</p>

<p>We started down stream once more, passing a
tributary stream, 5 m. wide, on the left bank. We
had only gone 9 kil. when to our great joy we
met two trading-boats owned by a Brazilian Jew, who
was on board in a critical condition from malarial
fever. Although in a dying state, he had not lost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-259" id="Pg_2-259"></a>[<a href="./images/2-259.png">259</a>]</span>
his racial commercial ability. It was most interesting
to watch his expiring countenance while trying
to strike the best bargain possible. He sold me
sixty candles for 60<i>s.</i>, eight biscuits for the equivalent
of 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and a quantity of dried meat at 5<i>s.</i> a
pound.</p>

<p>He looked askance at us, as he could not make out
who we were, what we were doing up that river, where
we could have come from. At last he signed to me
that he had something to whisper in my ear. He
asked me if I was a runaway cashier from a bank! I
told him that if I had been a runaway cashier I would
certainly not come and spend my money on the Arinos-Juruena
River.</p>

<p>The sight of human beings again&mdash;if that term could
be applied indiscriminately to all we had met so far&mdash;had
greatly excited my men.</p>

<p>Some 13 kil. farther, the river being smooth but
swift, we came to a basin 700 m. broad, where the
river described a turn toward the north-east. We
came upon a large clearing on the hill-side on the left
bank. There we saw the remains of two or three huts
which had been destroyed by fire. We perceived one or
two people, and we landed. We found that it was the
shed of an enterprising Peruvian trader who had
established himself there in order to collect rubber.
Only a few days before we arrived a great fire had
taken place, which had destroyed nearly all he possessed;
but&mdash;fortunately for us&mdash;they had saved a
few things, and I was able to purchase a quantity of
rice, biscuits, dried meat, beans, <i>farinha</i>, condensed
milk, <i>banho</i> (liquid lard in tins), and a number of other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-260" id="Pg_2-260"></a>[<a href="./images/2-260.png">260</a>]</span>
things, such as clothes, shirts, rope, nails, axes, etc.,
which we needed badly.</p>

<p>The Peruvian trader&mdash;of the Brothers Mori's firm&mdash;must
have had a handsome store indeed at that place,
a quantity of jewellery, rifles, pistols, etc., all badly
injured by the fire, being seen strewn on the ground
as we walked about.</p>

<p>The Peruvians are wonderful traders, most remarkable
people for exploring unknown regions and
carrying on commerce to the most distant points where
human beings are found. That particular Peruvian firm
had foreseen that that region will some day develop
to a great extent, and they had therefore established
their store at the most distant point where it was
possible to navigate the river without extraordinary
dangers.</p>

<p>The prices charged by the Peruvian, even when
circumstances might have led him to put a high price
on the goods he sold me, were far lower than those of
the Jew in his dying moments.</p>

<p>The river was there 1,000 m. wide, and of amazing
beauty, flowing to 30&deg; b.m. N.N.E. for 5,000 m. in a
direct line.</p>

<p>We had gone 30 kil. that day, and we had had so
many things happen to us, we felt so rich and happy
with our new purchases and with the prospect that
our trials were nearly over, that when night came we
had a grand meal, and slept soundly notwithstanding
the swarms of mosquitoes which buzzed around
us.</p>

<p class="fsc">The S. Sim&atilde;o Waterfall.</p>
<hr />
<p>During the night of August 18th the minimum temperature
was 71&deg; F. During the day the temperature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-261" id="Pg_2-261"></a>[<a href="./images/2-261.png">261</a>]</span>
of the air was not much warmer&mdash;only 78&deg; F. in the
shade with a nice breeze, while 113&deg; F. were registered
in the sun.</p>

<p>We halted for one day in order to repair the canoe,
as it was all we could do to keep her afloat, she was
leaking so badly. Poor Benedicto, who had spent the
last few weeks baling out the water, swore that the
moment he could leave the expedition he certainly
would, since he felt he should turn into a fish soon, as
he had not been dry one second for the last two
months.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature during the night of
August 19th was 72&deg; F.</p>

<p>When we proceeded down the river we came upon
most beautiful sand beaches, one as much as 500 m.
long. Quantities of most delicious tortoise eggs were
to be found. Furthermore, we killed some giant
tortoises. Altogether we felt that all of a sudden we
had dropped from a regular inferno into a heaven on
earth.</p>

<p>My men were paddling away with great vigour and
were making rapid progress, the river flowing almost
all the time northward, with deviations of a few degrees
toward the east, in stretches from 2,000 to 6,000 m.
in length. We crossed an immense basin 1,500 m.
broad with most gorgeous sand beaches. Their formation
in small dunes, occasionally with an edge like the
teeth of a double comb, was most interesting. Once
or twice we came to musical sands such as we had
found before. Everywhere on those beaches I noticed
the wonderful miniature sand plants, of which I made
a complete collection.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-262" id="Pg_2-262"></a>[<a href="./images/2-262.png">262</a>]</span>
As we went down we came to one or two <i>seringueiros</i>'
huts, and to a store belonging to our friend
the dying Jew, who rejoiced in the name of Moses.
As he had taken all the stuff with him in the trading
boat in order to exchange it for rubber from the
collectors, he had left nothing in the store except a
cheap straw hat.</p>

<p>As my hat by that time had lost most of its brim,
and the top of it had got loose and was moving up and
down in the breeze, I thought I would not lose the
opportunity of getting new headgear. So the purchase
was made there and then, and thus fashionably
attired I started once more down stream.</p>

<p>We passed on the way most impressive sand banks
and beaches&mdash;500, 700, and one 1,500 m. long. The
river in some spots was 1,000 m. wide. A great island
4,000 m. in length&mdash;Bertino Miranda Island&mdash;was then
passed, with a beautiful spit of sand 15 ft. high at its
southern end. Hillocks were visible first on the left
bank, then on the right. Other elongated sand accumulations
of great length were found beyond the big
island, one a huge tail of sand extending towards the
north for 1,000 m. Beyond those accumulations the
river was not less than 1500 m. across, and there an
immense beach of really extraordinary beauty ran on
the right side for a length of 1&frac12; kil.</p>

<p>On that beach we halted for lunch. In the afternoon
we continued, between banks on either side of
alluvial formation, principally silts and clay, light grey in
colour or white. In fact, the soil in the section directly
below the higher terrace of the great central plateau
of Matto Grosso, was formed by extensive alluvial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-263" id="Pg_2-263"></a>[<a href="./images/2-263.png">263</a>]</span>
accumulations which had made an immense terrace
extending right across all Central Brazil from west to
east, roughly speaking from the Madeira River to the
Araguaya and beyond.</p>

<p>After we had gone some 5 kil. in a straight line
from our camp to 10&deg; b.m., we perceived a headland
with a hill upon it 200 ft. high. We had been greatly
troubled in the afternoon for the last two days by
heavy showers of rain and gusts of a north-westerly
wind. Once or twice we got entangled in channels
among the many islands, and had to retrace our course,
but we went on until late in the evening, my men
believing firmly that we had now reached civilization
again and that the journey would be over in a few
days. I did not care to disillusion them.</p>

<p>Late at night we camped on a magnificent beach,
1,000 m. long, at the end of Araujo Island, 1,200 m.
in length.</p>

<p>We had gone that day, August 19th, 46 kil. 500 m.</p>

<p>My men hung their hammocks on the edge of the
forest. That camp was extremely damp and unhealthy.
When we woke up the next morning all my
followers were attacked by fever and were shivering
with cold.</p>

<p>We left at 7.30 a.m. under a limpid sky of gorgeous
cobalt blue. We passed two islands&mdash;one 700 m. long
(Leda Island), the other 2,000 m. (Leander Island).
When we had gone but 11,500 m. we arrived at
one of the most beautiful bits of river scenery I
have ever gazed upon&mdash;the spot where the immense
S. Manoel River or Tres Barras or Paranatinga met the
Arinos-Juruena. The latter river at that spot de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-264" id="Pg_2-264"></a>[<a href="./images/2-264.png">264</a>]</span>scribed
a sharp turn from 20&deg; b.m. to 320&deg; b.m. We
perceived a range of hills before us to the north. Close
to the bank gradually appeared a large shed with a
clearing near it on a high headland some 200 ft. above
the level of the river where the stream turned. On
the left bank, before we arrived at the meeting-place of
those two giant streams, we found a tributary, the
Bararati, 30 m. broad.</p>

<p>The S. Manoel River showed in its centre an elongated
island stretching in an E.N.E. direction. Where
the Arinos-Juruena met the S. Manoel it was 1,000 m.
wide, the S. Manoel being 800 m. wide at the point of
junction.</p>

<p>No sooner had we turned to 320&deg; b.m. than we
perceived on our left the <i>collectoria</i> of S. Manoel, with
two or three neat buildings. Several astonished people
rushed down to the water as they saw the canoe
approaching. When I landed the Brazilian official in
charge of that place and his assistants embraced me
tenderly and took me inside their house. When I told
them how we had come down the river, tears streamed
down their cheeks, so horrified were they.</p>

<p>"Did you come in that log of wood?" said the
collector, pointing to my canoe. I said I had. "Good
gracious me!" he exclaimed. "I will not let you go
another yard in that dangerous conveyance. I will
confiscate it, as I need a trough for my pigs and it will
just do for that purpose, and not for navigating a dangerous
river like this. If you want to go on by river
I will supply you with a good boat."</p>

<p>That was the last time I put my foot inside my
canoe. I removed for good the British flag which had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-265" id="Pg_2-265"></a>[<a href="./images/2-265.png">265</a>]</span>
flown daily at her stern, and it gave me quite a <i>serrement

<div class="blockquot"><p>A Fiscal Agency&mdash;Former Atrocities&mdash;The Apiacar Indians&mdash;Plentiful
Rubber&mdash;Unexploited Regions&mdash;Precious Fossils thrown away by

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> State of Matto Grosso had recently established a
fiscal agency at the junction of the two rivers in order
to collect the tax on the rubber exported from that
region. The Fiscal Agent, Mr. Jos&eacute; Sotero Barretto,
and his assistant, Mr. Julio Vieira Nery, were intelligent
and polished gentlemen. Their predecessor was not
like them. His barbarity, not only to the Apiacar
Indians but also to the Brazilians in his employ, was
almost incredible. For no reason whatever he killed
men right and left, until one day as he was getting
out of his canoe one of his men shot him in the back.</p>

<p>So much has been said of late of atrocities in the
Putumayo Region that perhaps one may be allowed
to say that the Putumayo Region is not the only
place where atrocities have occurred. To any one not
acquainted with those regions it is difficult to understand
why those atrocities take place at all. Curiously
enough, they are due to a large extent to medicine.
Those regions are all extremely malarial. The people
who are ordered there are afraid of being infected long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-267" id="Pg_2-267"></a>[<a href="./images/2-267.png">267</a>]</span>
before they start on their journey. They begin taking
preventive quinine and arsenic, which renders them
most irritable and ill-tempered; the solitude preys
upon them, and they add to the poisoning from medicine
the evil effects of excessive drinking. Add again to
this that few men can manage to be brave for a long
period of time, and that the brain gradually becomes
unbalanced, and you have the reason why murders are
committed wholesale in a stupid effort chiefly to preserve
oneself.</p>

<p>The Apiacar Indians, I was told, were formerly
much more numerous in that region than at present.
Most of them had been killed off, and their women
stolen. When Mr. Barretto arrived at the <i>collectoria</i> he
had great trouble in persuading the Indians to come
near him; but he has been so extremely kind to them
that now the entire tribe&mdash;some twenty people&mdash;have
established themselves at the <i>collectoria</i> itself, where
they are given work to do as police, rubber collectors,
and agriculturists combined. Mr. Barretto and his
assistant were much respected and loved by the natives.
Unlike his predecessor, he treated them with the greatest
consideration and generosity.</p>

<p>Mr. Barretto furnished me with an interesting table
showing the amount of production and export of
rubber from that district for the year 1910. From this
table it appears that from May 3rd to December 31st
30,356 kil. of the finest quality rubber, 10,153 kil. of
<i>sernamby</i> (or scrap rubber), 4,858 kil. of <i>caoutchouc</i>, and
30,655 kil. of <i>sernamby caoutchouc</i>&mdash;altogether a total of
76,022 kil.&mdash;passed through the <i>collectoria</i> on the Matto
Grosso side, which does not include the opposite side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-268" id="Pg_2-268"></a>[<a href="./images/2-268.png">268</a>]</span>
of the river, belonging to the Province of Para, where
another <i>collectoria</i> has been established. That quantity
of rubber had been collected by some eighty people,
all told, including the local Indians.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-268a.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-268a_th.jpg" alt="Mundurucu Indians." title="Mundurucu Indians." /></a></p>

<p class="fsc">Mundurucu Indians.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was impossible to get labour up that river. The
few <i>seringueiros</i>, chiefly negroes who were there in
absolute slavery, had been led and established by their
masters up the river, with no chance of getting away.
Their masters came, of course, every year to bring
down the rubber that had been collected. Twenty
times the quantity could easily be brought down to
the coast if labour were obtainable. Not only was the
Juruena River itself almost absolutely untouched commercially&mdash;as
we have seen, we did not meet a soul
during the fifty days we navigated it&mdash;but even important
tributaries close to S. Manoel, such as the
Euphrasia, the S&atilde;o Thom&eacute;, the S&atilde;o Florencio, the
Misericordia, and others, were absolutely desert regions,
although the quantity of rubber to be found along those
streams must be immense. The difficulty of transport,
even on the Tapajoz&mdash;from the junction of the two
rivers the Juruena took the name of Tapajoz River&mdash;was
very great, although the many rapids there encountered
were mere child's play in comparison with
those we had met with up above. In them, nevertheless,
many lives were lost and many valuable cargoes
disappeared for ever yearly. The rubber itself was not
always lost when boats were wrecked, as rubber floats,
and some of it was generally recovered. The expense
of a journey up that river was enormous; it took forty
to sixty days from the mouth of the Tapajoz to reach
the <i>collectoria</i> of S. Manoel. Thus, on an average the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-269" id="Pg_2-269"></a>[<a href="./images/2-269.png">269</a>]</span>
cost of freight on each kilo (about 2 lb.) of rubber
between those two points alone was not less than
sevenpence or eightpence.</p>

<p>As the River Tapajoz is extremely tortuous and
troublesome, I think that some day, in order to exploit
that region fully, it will be found necessary to cut a
road through the forest from S. Manoel to one of the
tributaries of the Madeira, such as the River Secundury-Canuma,
from which the rubber could be taken down
to the Amazon in a few days.</p>

<p>From the point of junction of the River Tres Barras
or S. Manoel and the Juruena, the river was fairly well
known. It was partly in order to ascertain whether
the project of the road from S. Manoel to the Madeira
were feasible, that I decided to leave the river and
cross the forest due west as far as the Madeira River.</p>

<p>I spent two or three most delightful days enjoying
the generous hospitality of Mr. Barretto. I was able to
purchase from him a quantity of provisions, enough to
last us some three months, and consisting of tinned
food, rice, beans, <i>farinha</i>, sugar, coffee, and dried meat.</p>

<p>Mr. Barretto kindly arranged to send his assistant,
Mr. Julio Nery, and three Apiacar Indians in order to
help me along during the first two or three days of our
journey into the forest.</p>

<p>As I should be travelling on foot from that point
across virgin forest, and we should have to carry
whatever baggage we had, it was necessary for me to
abandon all the things which were not of absolute importance,
so as to make the loads as light as possible.</p>

<p>I left behind at S. Manoel a tent, some of my rifles,
a quantity of cartridges, etc., the only articles I took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-270" id="Pg_2-270"></a>[<a href="./images/2-270.png">270</a>]</span>
along with me besides provisions being my cameras,
instruments, the photographic plates already exposed,
with some two hundred plates for further work, and
the geological and botanical collections, which by that
time had got to be valuable.</p>

<p>As I was unpacking the different cases in order to
sort out the baggage, I came to the box where I expected
to find the precious fossil human skull and the
vertebr&aelig; I had discovered in Matto Grosso. To my
horror the fossils were to be found nowhere. I asked
Alcides and the other men, and pressed them for an
answer. I received a terrible blow indeed when they
confessed that nearly a month before, one night while
I was asleep, they had taken the valuable possessions
and had flung them into the river. Their excuse was
that the loads were heavy enough in carting baggage
along the rapids, and they would not be burdened with
what they called "stupid stones."</p>

<p>This last bit of infamy turned me so much against
my men that I could not bear the sight of them. It
will be easily understood that when you go to such
great expense and risk as I did in obtaining valuable
material, and had obtained it, to be deprived of it
through the ignorance and meanness of one's own men,
who were treated with the greatest generosity from
beginning to end, was certainly most exasperating.
In a half-hearted way I packed up all the other things
and made ready to continue the journey. The contempt
I had for my men from that day, nevertheless,
made it quite painful to me to be in their company.
At S. Manoel the men gave me no end of trouble.
Benedicto refused to go on any longer. The other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-271" id="Pg_2-271"></a>[<a href="./images/2-271.png">271</a>]</span>
men wanted to halt there for a month in order to
recuperate their strength. Filippe the negro was
drunk, and slept all the time we were there.</p>

<p>I know too well that on expeditions it is fatal to
halt anywhere; therefore I was anxious to push on
at once. The night before our departure Mr. Barretto
gave a grand dinner-party in my honour, long speeches
being read out by him and his assistant, when we sat
down on rough wooden benches and packing-cases to
a most elaborate meal of fried fish, grilled fish, boiled
fish, tortoise eggs&mdash;quantities of them&mdash;stewed pork
and roast pork. A whole sucking-pig adorned the
table. The greatest happiness reigned that night at
table, and I owe a deep debt of gratitude to Mr. Barretto
for his exquisite kindness during the two or
three days I was his guest. My men were also asked
to the banquet, and had a good fill. But I felt extremely
sad, quite broken-hearted, over the loss of the
fossils, and I could really enjoy nothing notwithstanding
outward appearances.</p>

<p>After dinner, when my men had retired, Mr. Barretto
and his assistant expressed great surprise at my
not having been murdered by my followers before then.
They said that in their whole experience they had never
come across such impossible creatures. They could
not understand how the Governor of Goyaz could
possibly let me start in such company. They seemed
most anxious for me, as some of my men had evidently,
while drunk, spoken at the <i>collectoria</i> and said things
which had greatly upset and frightened the fiscal
agent.</p>

<p>Three days after my arrival in S. Manoel I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-272" id="Pg_2-272"></a>[<a href="./images/2-272.png">272</a>]</span>
ready to depart, having conceived a plan to go some
60 kil. farther by river to a point from where I would
strike due west across the forest as far as the Madeira
River. I was just about to go on board the boat
placed at my disposal by Mr. Barretto, when a terrific
storm broke out, with lightning and thunder, and a
howling wind which blew with fury, raising high waves
in the river&mdash;very wide at that point. It was a wonderful
spectacle, with the river in commotion and the
dazzling flashes of lightning across the inky sky.
Amidst it I saw my faithful canoe being dashed mercilessly
by the waves time after time against some sharp
rocks, until she broke in two and foundered. I was
sorry to see her disappear, for she had served me well.</p>

<p>When after a couple of hours the storm cleared, I
took my departure, on August 24th. During my stay
at S. Manoel I had taken observations for latitude
(7&deg; 16&#8242;&middot;9 S.), longitude (58&deg; 34&#8242; W.), and elevation
(601 ft. a.s.l. on the river, 721 ft. at the <i>collectoria</i>).</p>

<p class="fsc">Author taking Astronomical Observations on a Sandy Beach of the River Arinos-Juruena.</p>
<hr />
<p>Just across the river, at the mouth of the Tres
Barras, was the <i>collectoria</i> for the State of Par&aacute;. The
Par&aacute; <i>seringueiros</i> worked on the Rio Tres Barras and its
tributaries on its right side&mdash;that is to say, the Annipir&iacute;,
the Igarap&eacute; Preto, the Cururu, and another (nameless)
stream. There were, perhaps, altogether some eighty
or a hundred <i>seringueiros</i>, all told, working in that
immense region on the Par&aacute; side. In the year 1910,
90,000 kil. of rubber were collected by those few
<i>seringueiros</i>, and in the year 1911 a slightly larger
amount was sent down the river from that point. The
Par&aacute; Fiscal Agency was only established there on
December 11th, 1910. The <i>collectoria</i> was situated in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-273" id="Pg_2-273"></a>[<a href="./images/2-273.png">273</a>]</span>
a most beautiful spot on a high point overlooking the
mouth of the Tres Barras, and directly facing the
Juruena-Arinos. On the Juruena previous to reaching
S. Manoel on the left side was a stream in which gold
was to be found.</p>

<p>Amid the affectionate farewells of Mr. Barretto I
left S. Manoel in a beautiful boat belonging to the
fiscal agent. The effects of light on the water were
wonderful after the storm. The river, immensely wide,
flowed in a N.N.W. direction, then due north in great
straight stretches from 2 to 4 kil. in length. As we
had left late in the afternoon we were not able to
go far. We passed some beautiful islands, one particularly
of immense length, with an extensive sandy
beach at its southern end. After going some 18 kil.
we came to a great barrier of rocks extending across
the river from south-west to north-east. Some distance
below those rocks a great sand-bank spread half-way
across the stream.</p>

<p>We halted for the night at the <i>fazenda</i> of Colonel
Gregorio, a <i>seringueiro</i> from whom I expected to get
an Indian who knew the forest well and who could be
of some assistance to me in going across it. The house
of Col. Gregorio&mdash;a mere big shed&mdash;was a regular
armoury, a great many rifles of all ages, sizes, and
shapes adorning the walls; then there were fishing
spears and harpoons, vicious-looking knives and axes.
In the principal room was a large altar with a carved
figure of the Virgin standing with joined hands before
lighted candles and a bottle of green peppermint. The
latter was not an offering to the sacred image, but
it was placed on the revered spot so that none of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-274" id="Pg_2-274"></a>[<a href="./images/2-274.png">274</a>]</span>
Gregorio's men should touch it. Enormous balls of
rubber filled the greater portion of the floor, waiting
to be taken down the river.</p>

<p>With great trouble the Indian&mdash;a man called
Miguel&mdash;was induced to accompany me; also a young
boy, who, at a salary of 15<i>s.</i> a day, agreed to act as
carrier.</p>

<p>It was not until late in the afternoon on August 25th
that we left the <i>fazenda</i> in order to proceed down the
stream. We passed the tributary river Roncador on
the left side, with its beautiful high waterfall a short
distance before it enters the Tapajoz. We came soon
afterwards to the island of S. Benedicto, south of
which on the left bank was the hill of the Veado, 120 ft.
high. Directly in front of the island, also on the left
bank, was the Mount of S. Benedicto, where legends
say an image of that saint exists carved out by nature
in the high rocky cliff.</p>

<p>As we passed under the hill our crew fired
several volleys in honour of the saint; then we landed
and I climbed up to go and see the wonderful image.
Many candles had been burnt on a platform of rock
on the cliff side, and the sailors who came up with me
brought a new supply of stearine and set them ablaze
on that natural altar. The men pointed out to me the
figure of the saint, but with all the best intentions in
the world I could see no resemblance whatever to a
human being.</p>

<p>"There it is! there it is!" they shouted, as I
twisted my head one way and the other to see if I
could find a point of view from which I could see the
saint. The men knelt down and prayed fervently for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-275" id="Pg_2-275"></a>[<a href="./images/2-275.png">275</a>]</span>
some minutes, as they believed it was necessary to
pay these signs of respect in order to ensure a good
journey down the river. Some went as far as to tear
off pieces of their garments and leave them on the
rocky platform as offerings.</p>

<p>The eastern face of the S. Benedicto Mount was a
vertical wall 200 ft. high in horizontal strata of a deep
grey colour, and some 300 m. in length along the river.</p>

<p>We had wasted so much time, and the men rowed
so badly, that we made poor progress. We only went
21 kil. that day. We halted for the night near a
<i>seringueiro's</i> hut at the small rapid of Meia Carga, or
Half-charge Rapid, because at low water the boats
have to be half unloaded in order to get over that spot.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature during the night was
69&deg; F. We slept in the boat, and were simply devoured
by mosquitoes. The chief of the Indians who had
been lent me by the Fiscal Agent became seriously ill
during the night with a severe attack of fever. All
my men, with no exception, also became ill, and were
shivering with cold, owing to fever. The chief of the
police, Luiz Perreira da Silva, who had been placed by
Mr. Barretto in charge of the Indians who were to
accompany me, in jumping from the boat that night
on to the shore hurt his foot, the pain caused by that
slight injury giving him also a severe attack of fever.
So that of the entire crew there remained only two
men in good health&mdash;viz. Mr. Julio Nery and myself.</p>

<p>Amid moans and groans we got the boat under way
at 6.45 the next morning, the men paddling in a half-hearted
manner. As the current was strong we drifted
down fairly quickly in a northerly direction, the river<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-276" id="Pg_2-276"></a>[<a href="./images/2-276.png">276</a>]</span>
there being in a perfectly straight line for some 8,000 m.
The width of the river was 1,300 m.</p>

<p>Behind a little island on the left side, and approached
through a circle of dangerous rocks, was the
hut of a <i>seringueiro</i> called Albuquerque, a man in the
employ of Colonel Brazil, the greatest rubber trader on
the river Tapajoz. We landed at that point and made
preparations so that I could start at once on the
journey on foot across the virgin forest.</p>

<p>The loads the men were to carry were not heavy&mdash;merely
from 35 to 40 lb. each&mdash;the heaviest load
being the one I carried, so as to give a good example
to my men. We had ample provisions to last us, with
a little economy, three months. When the moment
arrived to depart there was not one man who could
stand up on his legs; the policeman with his injured
foot could not even land from the boat, as it gave him
so much pain. The chief of the Indians was so ill
with the fever and the medicine he had taken that he
really looked as if he might not survive. The other
Indians refused to leave their chief; while the Indian
Miguel, whom I had employed subsequently, flatly
refused to come along. Much time was wasted talking,
Mr. Nery, a fluent speaker, haranguing the men, who
lay around helpless, holding their heads between their
hands or rolling themselves on the ground.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how many ailments fright can
produce.</p>

<p>The accounts of the forest which I had heard in the
neighbourhood were most conflicting. It was really
impossible to tell beforehand what the crossing overland
between the Tapajoz and the Madeira River would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-277" id="Pg_2-277"></a>[<a href="./images/2-277.png">277</a>]</span>
be like. In order to encourage my own men I had
once more increased their pay for the extra hard work
I required of them on that occasion, and I promised
them each a further present of money if they succeeded
in carrying all the loads safely as far as the
Madeira River.</p>

<p>They had agreed to do the work, but unfortunately
they were the most unpractical men I have ever come
across, and insisted on carrying the loads in a way
which made it impossible for them to carry them for
any long distance. For instance, one man insisted on
carrying a heavy wooden packing-case slung on one
side of the body just over the hip, in the fashion in
which Italians carry barrel-organs in the streets of
cities; another man suspended a case on his back
by a strap which went round his neck, so that after
a few minutes he was absolutely strangled; while
Filippe the negro let his load hang so low that it would
certainly cause a bad sore on his spine. I tried to
teach them, but it was no use, as it only led to a row.
Absolutely disgusted with the whole crowd of them,
late that afternoon of August 26th I made ready to
start on our difficult journey.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> three o'clock in the afternoon I had been able to
induce the Indian Miguel, his friend the carrier, and
three other Apiacar Indians to come along with us for
a few days in order to carry the heavier packages as
far as possible into the forest, so that I could spare
my men.</p>

<p>It was some relief to me&mdash;although I saw plainly
that we should surely have disaster sooner or later&mdash;when
one after the other my men took up their loads
and started off. I gave them the correct direction
with the compass, almost due west; in fact, to make
it easier for them I told them that afternoon to travel
in the direction of the sun.</p>

<p>With Filippe the negro at the head my own men
started off at a rapid pace, the others following, while
I was at the tail of the procession in order to see that
no stragglers remained behind. For a short distance
we found an old <i>picada</i> which went practically in the
direction we wanted, so my men followed it, only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-279" id="Pg_2-279"></a>[<a href="./images/2-279.png">279</a>]</span>
cutting when necessary the vegetation which had grown
up here and there.</p>

<p>I had only gone a few hundred metres when I saw
the ground a little way off our track covered with
some white substance. With my usual curiosity I
went to see what it was, and found to my disgust a
large quantity of rice which had evidently been scattered
about there a few moments before. A few yards
farther was another patch of white upon the ground,
as if it had snowed. A whole sack of flour had been
emptied and scattered about in such a way that it
could not be recovered.</p>

<p>I well knew what was happening. My men were
throwing away everything in order to make the loads
lighter. So relieved of the weight, they had got far
ahead, while the Apiacar Indians who had remained
behind were behaving in so strange a fashion that I
had to stay in charge of them, so that they should not
escape with the boxes of instruments and collections
which they were carrying for me.</p>

<p>We went that afternoon some 6 kil. through fairly
clean forest, barring a few obstacles such as huge,
ancient, fallen trees, the insides of which were all
rotted away or eaten up by ants. In one of the cavities
of those trees I found another quantity of food which
had been hidden by my men. Hampered by the
Indians, who were giving me no end of trouble as they
refused to carry their loads, it took me some little time
to catch up with my other men. When I did I found
them all seated, smacking their lips. They were
filling their mouths as fast as they could with handfuls
of sugar. When I reprimanded them there was an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-280" id="Pg_2-280"></a>[<a href="./images/2-280.png">280</a>]</span>
unpleasant row. They said they were not beasts of
burden, that men were not made to carry, and that
therefore they had thrown away all the food. Under
no circumstance would they carry loads any farther.</p>

<p>A great deal of tact and persuasion were required.
Alcides had discarded nearly all the stuff he carried,
and was one of the chief offenders on that occasion.</p>

<p>Matters looked bad. We camped that night near
a little streamlet at the point where it had its birth.
We still had plenty of food left, notwithstanding what
they had thrown away. I warned them that if they
threw away any more we should certainly all die
of starvation. During the night one of the Indians
ran away carrying with him a quantity of our provisions.</p>

<p>On August 27th I once more proceeded on the
march westward, this time with no <i>picada</i> at all to
follow, but cutting our way all the time through the
forest. Mr. Julio Nery, who had been sent with me,
was an enthusiastic and brave man, but in trying to
help made us waste a great deal of energy and time.
After marching eight hours we had only gone 10 kil.
in the right direction, having made many deviations
in order to find what he called a more suitable way.
We travelled occasionally over thickly wooded, slightly
undulating country, but generally the land was flat.</p>

<hr />
<p>In the afternoon, when we arrived at the foot of a
small hill, we were caught in a drenching storm, the
foliage letting the water down upon us in profusion.
The walking became heavy. In order to make the
loads lighter, my men had removed from the packages
the waterproof coverings I had made for them from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-281" id="Pg_2-281"></a>[<a href="./images/2-281.png">281</a>]</span>
waterproof sheets. The result was that in that storm
nearly our entire supply of salt&mdash;some 50 lb. of it&mdash;was
lost. The powdered sugar, too, suffered considerably,
and became a solid sticky mass.</p>

<p>We arrived at a stream 10 m. broad flowing from
north to south, where we had to halt, as my men said
they were absolutely exhausted and could not go
another step. The water of that stream was simply
delicious. We killed a monkey, which my men ate
eagerly for dinner.</p>

<p>On August 28th we left that stream at eight o'clock.
We were confronted by a succession of steep hills with
vertical rocks of immense size, on the summit of which
were great slabs also of rock, not unlike angular roofs of
houses. It was most difficult, I confess, for my men
to take the loads up and down those giant rocks,
especially as there were many fallen trees among them
and the rocks themselves were extremely slippery.</p>

<p>It would not do to repeat in these pages the language
of my men as they scrambled up and rolled
down the numerous rocks&mdash;falling so clumsily that
they always managed to injure themselves more or less.
I was sorry for my loads, especially the instruments,
which got knocked about in a pitiful way.</p>

<p>We came across three distinct hill ranges of that
type, over which we had to travel, the highest point
being some 300 ft. above the level of the Tapajoz
River. The last bit in particular of that hilly region
was diabolically steep, with loose rocks which gave us
no end of trouble. A beautiful little streamlet flowing
east descended in cascades among those huge rocks.
Eventually we reached the summit of the plateau, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-282" id="Pg_2-282"></a>[<a href="./images/2-282.png">282</a>]</span>
huge flat expanse of dark red volcanic rock. My men
were so tired that we had to camp on that elevation.
Nothing but a few shrubs grew in the interstices of
that great table of rock, which extended for several
kilometres to the north. The barrier of rock, a spur
of the great central plateau, was very interesting from
a geological point of view.</p>

<p>On August 29th we again marched westward,
cutting our way through the forest, and found two
streamlets&mdash;one flowing south, the other north. Late
in the afternoon we arrived at a spot where there
was another great mass of rock, most troublesome
for us. My men were discontented, saying that when
they agreed to march through the forest they had
not agreed to march over rocks&mdash;as if I had placed
these there on purpose to annoy them. They were
extremely morose. I knew by their manner that I had
fresh trouble in store.</p>

<p>In the centre of that second immense table of rock
I found a few pools of putrid rain-water in cavities.
My men wanted to halt there, but I induced them to
march along in hopes of finding a stream at the bottom
of the tableland. Unluckily we went on and on until
the evening and we found no more water at all. Only
a torrential shower came upon us during the night,
and we were able to fill our cups with water to quench
our thirst. Men and baggage got soaked in that storm.
The loads were much heavier to carry the next morning.</p>

<p>On August 30th, when I called the men in order
to make a start, two of them were attacked severely
by fever, their temperature being 103&deg;. They seemed
to be in agony, and had no strength left.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-283" id="Pg_2-283"></a>[<a href="./images/2-283.png">283</a>]</span>
Mr. Julio Nery said that his duties called him back
to his post, and he must return with the Indians under
his charge. He accompanied me up to lunch-time,
when we all together had a hearty meal. After lunch
I gave Mr. Nery and his men ample provisions to return
to the river Tapajoz, where the boat was awaiting
them. Not only that, but I presented Mr. Nery with
a handsome rifle and a watch, in remembrance of his
politeness to me. In order that he might have a
pleasant journey back I also gave him the few tins of
delicacies which I had brought for myself, the only
four tins of condensed milk I had been able to obtain
in S. Manoel, and a few tins of sardines which had
remained from my provisions I had taken over from
England, and which he liked very much.</p>

<p>It was a great trial to me to see how my men
wasted food all the time. When I examined the
loads once more I found that nearly the entire supply
of flour, <i>farinha</i>, rice, lard, and much of the tinned
stuff had been thrown away. We had been marching
four and a half days, and out of the three months'
provisions we only had food enough left to last us a
few days.</p>

<p>With my reduced party of my six original men,
the Indian Miguel and his friend the carrier&mdash;eight
altogether&mdash;I started once more in a westerly direction,
opening a <i>picada</i>&mdash;that is to say, cutting our way
through the forest.</p>

<p>We crossed two streamlets flowing north. After
that we came upon a most troublesome patch of
swampy land with high reeds in it, the leaves of which
cut our hands like razors when we forced our way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-284" id="Pg_2-284"></a>[<a href="./images/2-284.png">284</a>]</span>
through them, struggling in mud and slush up to our
knees, sometimes as high as our waists. A streamlet
flowing north formed the marsh in that low place.
The moment we had got out of the marsh the men
threw themselves down and said they could go no
farther. I pointed out to them that that spot was
most unhealthy, and tried to persuade them to go some
distance from that pestilential place. But they would
not listen to reason, and there they would stay.</p>

<p>Although I had offered them every possible inducement
to come on&mdash;their original high pay had been
practically trebled as long as the hard work should last&mdash;and
I had treated them with the greatest consideration,
yet they refused to come any farther. They said
they had decided to go back.</p>

<p>In examining my loads I found that they had
abandoned my sextant and other instruments in the
forest, and it was only after a great deal of talking
that I could induce the man X to go back with me
to recover them, for which service he received an
immediate present of one pound sterling.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, that evening my men shot
a plump <i>jaho</i> (<i>Crypturus notivagus</i>) and a large <i>mutum</i>
(<i>Crax pinima</i>), two enormous birds, most excellent to eat.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-284a.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-284a_th.jpg" alt="Apiacar Women." title="Apiacar Women." /></a></p>

<p class="fsc">Apiacar Women.</p>
<hr />
<p>That camp was stifling, the moisture being excessive,
and the miasma rising from the putrid water
poisoning my men in a disastrous way. The drinking-water,
too, from that swamp was full of germs of all
sizes, so big that with the naked eye you could see
hundreds of them in your cup. We could not boil the
water because all our matches had got wet. We
wasted hundreds of them in trying to light a fire, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-285" id="Pg_2-285"></a>[<a href="./images/2-285.png">285</a>]</span>
with no success. Flint and steel also proved useless,
because the wood was also soaking wet and would
not ignite.</p>

<p>August 31st was a painful day for me. Two of the
men were badly laid up with fever, the others were
most obnoxious. I had endless trouble in making
them take up their loads and start once more. The
man X said he would take the load which contained
my instruments, but he would certainly leave it, as
soon as he had an opportunity, concealed in a spot
where it could not be found again. I told him in plain
words that if he carried out his intention I would shoot
him dead, and I would from that moment do the same
to any other man who rebelled. I was surprised to
find that the lot of them took their loads upon their
shoulders and proceeded to march along as quietly as
possible.</p>

<p>The Brazilian forest was&mdash;unlike the equatorial
forest of Africa&mdash;comparatively clean underneath, there
being very little undergrowth. It was quite easy to
cut one's way through if one knew how. There was a
great art in cutting one's way through the forest. If
you happened to know the way trees grew or liane
were suspended, it was easy enough to cut them
with one sharp blow of the large knives. But if you
did not happen to know the formation of the trees
and you struck them the wrong way, you had to hit
them many times before you knocked them down.
The same thing and worse happened with liane, which
could be severed easily with one stroke if it were applied
the right way, but which wound round and entangled
you in a merciless manner if hit at a wrong angle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-286" id="Pg_2-286"></a>[<a href="./images/2-286.png">286</a>]</span>
No observant person, however, experiences trouble
in marching through the Brazilian forest, and if not
hindered by impossible followers it would be quite
easy to march long distances daily in any part of the
forest without much inconvenience.</p>

<p>This statement only applies to the actual marching,
and does not at all mean that you had not to go through
severe sufferings and endless trials of other kinds.
Unless you were careful where you were sitting, you
found yourself spiked by thorns of great length which
were strewn all over the forest hidden under the thick
carpet of discarded foliage from the trees. Not only
that, but the moment you sat down your body was
simply invaded by swarms of ants of all sizes and
degrees of viciousness, which proceeded to bite you all
over with considerable vigour. There were not many
mosquitoes where the forest was dense, but there were
millions&mdash;in fact, milliards&mdash;of bees, which rendered
your life absolutely unbearable, as they clung to your
face, hands and clothes. Fortunately, they did not
sting, but clinging with their claws upon your skin
they produced such an irritation that you were nearly
driven mad by it.</p>

<p>Then there were fetid bugs of huge size, the sickening
odour of which when they touched you had quite
a nauseating effect. They seemed to have a particular
fondness for settling upon your lips or entering your
mouth. When by mishap you swallowed them, their
taste was something too appalling. Once or twice
while I was eating I had the misfortune to crack
one or two under my teeth. I had the bad taste of
them in my mouth for hours after.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-287" id="Pg_2-287"></a>[<a href="./images/2-287.png">287</a>]</span>
When we halted for lunch my men were in a shocking
condition. I could not quite understand what had
happened. Most of them seemed to suffer from violent
internal inflammation accompanied by high fever.</p>

<p>In order to make things as easy as possible for them
I once more rearranged the loads that afternoon,
abandoning six hundred rifle cartridges, several tins of
hyposulphite of soda, other chemicals, all the developing
trays, etc., for my photographic work, and a
number of valuable trinkets I had collected. Much to
my sorrow I had also to abandon the geological collection,
which was too heavy to be carried any farther.
Then I had to abandon all the books which were
necessary for working out my astronomical observations,
such as Norrie's <i>Navigation</i> and <i>The Nautical Almanac</i>,
and all possible articles which were not absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>After I had gone to the great trouble of unpacking
everything in order to make the loads lighter, I was
surprised to discover, a few minutes later, that the
men had appropriated most of the stuff and shoved
it back in their loads&mdash;in order, perhaps, to sell it
when they got to Manaos.</p>

<p>I said nothing, as it suited me very well. I should
have gladly repurchased the things from them on the
way. One man opened a tin of powdered hyposulphite
and, believing it to be powdered sugar, proceeded to
pour it down his throat. Had I the bad habit of
making puns, I should say that I just saved him in
time from being "fixed" for good. As it was he
swallowed some, and became very ill indeed for some
hours.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-288" id="Pg_2-288"></a>[<a href="./images/2-288.png">288</a>]</span>
We luckily killed a big <i>mutum</i> and two monkeys
before leaving that camp, but my men were so ill that
they left them on the ground, saying they had not the
strength to carry them so that we might eat them
for dinner. Well knowing what was in store for us, I
proceeded to carry the huge bird (much larger than
a big turkey) and one of the monkeys (as big as a
child three years old) upon my shoulders.</p>

<p>It was all I could do to struggle along under the
heavy load, as I already carried upon my person some
24 lb. in weight of gold, silver, other moneys, and
instruments, while on my shoulders hung a weight of
some 40 lb. Add to that the big bird and the monkey,
and altogether the weight was certainly not less than
90 lb. I was simply smothered under it.</p>

<p>We suffered a good deal that day from lack of
water and from the intense heat. There seemed to
be no air in the forest, and our breathing was heavy.
Each time a man fell down and refused to go on I
had to put down my load, go to his assistance and
persuade him to get up again. It was a most trying
experience.</p>

<p>After going some eight hours without finding a
drop of water, our throats absolutely parched with
thirst, we luckily came upon some <i>solveira</i> trees, which,
when incised, exuded most excellent milk&mdash;only, of
course, it dropped down tantalizingly slowly, while we
were cruelly thirsty, especially my men in their feverish
state. It was curious to see them all clinging to the
tree with their mouths applied to the wounds in order
to suck the milk.</p>

<p class="fsc">Apiacar Children.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some way farther on we came across some rubber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-289" id="Pg_2-289"></a>[<a href="./images/2-289.png">289</a>]</span>
trees&mdash;which fact made us joyful, as we knew water
would then be near. In fact, a kilometre beyond,
water of a deep reddish yellow colour was found in a
streamlet 10 m. wide, flowing north.</p>

<p>We halted on the western bank. We had been
cutting through the forest the entire day. My men
were simply exhausted. I, too, was glad when I put
down the bird and the monkey&mdash;particularly as they
had a pungent odour, quite typical of wild animals
of Brazil, which affected my nose for some hours
afterwards. Also they were covered with parasites,
which caused violent itching on my neck and shoulders,
on which they had been resting.</p>

<p>I had marched all the time, compass in hand, next
to the man who with the large knife opened the way
through the forest. We had travelled all day&mdash;cutting,
cutting all the time&mdash;and by the evening we had
gone about 10 kil.&mdash;that is to say, at the rate of a
little over 1 kil. an hour.</p>

<p>The yellow water of the stream&mdash;it looked just like
strong tea, and tasted of everything in the world
except water&mdash;had not a beneficial effect upon my
men. For some reason of their own the men, who
seldom took a bath in the clean rivers, insisted on
bathing in those coloured waters, which, I might also
add, were just then almost stagnant in that particular
section of the stream.</p>

<p>Personally, I had taken out a large cup full of
water before they had gone to bathe, and avoided
drinking again; but my men drank that water, made
dirtier by their immersion and the use of soap&mdash;my
soap, too!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-290" id="Pg_2-290"></a>[<a href="./images/2-290.png">290</a>]</span>
The next morning all had excruciating headaches.
Their legs dangled, and they did not seem to be able
to stand on them. Only the Indian&mdash;Miguel&mdash;seemed
to have any strength left. He was a nasty-looking
individual, always sulky and pensive as if under some
great weight upon his conscience. Miguel and I walked
in front, he with a big knife opening the way in the
forest for the others to come behind.</p>

<p>Just before leaving camp on September 1st I had
gone some distance up the yellow stream in order to
get a last drink in case we found no other water that
day. The Indian, who was supposed to know the
forest well, knew nothing whatever, and always misled
me whenever I asked for information.</p>

<p>A few minutes after we had left, I was seized with
violent shivers, my teeth chattered, and I felt quite
as frozen as if I had suddenly dropped in the Arctic
regions. Evidently I had been poisoned by the water.
I collapsed under my load, and for some moments I
could not get up again. Although I had spent all my
time and energy helping everybody else to get up
when in difficulty, not one of my men came near me
to unfasten the loads from my shoulders or help me
to get up on my legs again. They merely squatted a
little way off when they saw that I had collapsed, and
proceeded to roll up their cigarettes and smoke.</p>

<p>True, I did not let my men suspect that I was very
ill. After a few minutes I struggled up once more
under my heavy load and asked the men to come
along. I had been seized with such a violent attack
of fever that my strength seemed to have vanished all
of a sudden, my limbs quivering in a most alarming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-291" id="Pg_2-291"></a>[<a href="./images/2-291.png">291</a>]</span>
way. I carried a clinical thermometer on my person.
My temperature was 104&deg; F. From ten o'clock in the
morning until three in the afternoon the attack of
fever was so acute that several times I fell down. My
men, who were in a pitiable condition that day, collapsed,
now one, now another, although their loads
were less than half the weight of mine, each man carrying
about 40 lb. We marched until four o'clock that
afternoon, but only covered a distance of 6 kil. in
that entire day. Two of the men had abandoned their
loads altogether, as they could not carry them any
farther. What vexed me considerably was that they
had discarded my valuable things in preference to
leaving the great weight of rubbish of their own
which they insisted on carrying, such as looking-glasses,
combs, brushes, a number of old clothes in
shreds, and the heavy hammocks, which weighed not
less than 20 lb. each.</p>

<p>We found water in a streamlet which formed a
marsh. There my men insisted on making camp.
It was a most unhealthy spot. Ill as I was, I endeavoured
to induce them to come on a little farther
and see if we could improve on that halting-place.
Miguel, the Indian, who had slightly scratched his
finger, now refused to cut the <i>picada</i> any longer, as he
said the pain was intense. It was only by giving him
a present of money that I had succeeded in leading
the man on until we reached the marsh.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the man X, who was the champion
rascal of the crowd, proved himself that day to
be the best of the whole lot. He even went back with
me to try and recover some of the most important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-292" id="Pg_2-292"></a>[<a href="./images/2-292.png">292</a>]</span>
things from the loads which the men had abandoned
some 2 kil. before we had made our camp.</p>

<p>As we stumbled along we could not even lean
against the trees to have a little rest, as most of them
had thousands of horizontal thorns of great length
sticking out all around them. Innumerable thorns
were upon the ground. Our feet were full of them. I
looked all the time where I was putting my feet, but
sometimes the thorns were hidden under masses of
dried foliage, and they were so long and so strong that
they went clean through the sides of my shoes.</p>

<p>The last blow came to me that evening, when my
men informed me that we had no food whatever left.
All that remained of our three months' provisions were
six tins of sardines and one tin of anchovies. That was
all. My men made no secret of having thrown away
everything as we came along. The sugar, for which
they had a perfect craving, they had eaten, consuming
in the last two days the entire supply of 30 lb.,
which had remained until then. It was then that I
understood the cause of the internal inflammation from
which they all suffered. They were greatly excited,
and demanded the balance of their money, not wishing
to come on any more; they wanted to fall back on
the River Tapajoz and go home. There was a riot.
They threatened to shoot me if I insisted on their
coming on.</p>

<p>Just then a big black monkey appeared upon a
tree, inquisitively watching our doings. The man X
shot it. A moment later a big <i>jaho</i> was brought down,
also by the man X, who was the best shot of the party.
My men were never too ill to eat. They immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-293" id="Pg_2-293"></a>[<a href="./images/2-293.png">293</a>]</span>
proceeded to skin the poor monkey and pluck the
feathers from the bird, in order to prepare a hearty
meal. But they complained that they had no <i>feij&atilde;o</i>,
and no coffee after their dinner. When we started a
few days before we had a supply of 40 lb. of coffee.</p>

<p>Feasting on the meat did not seem to be a good
remedy for internal inflammation and fever. The next
morning my men were really in a precarious condition.
I saw that it was out of the question for them to
continue. Personally, I would certainly not go back.
I came to an understanding with them that I would
leave sufficient ammunition for them to shoot with, as
there seemed to be plenty of game in that particular part
of the forest. We would divide equally what provisions
we had&mdash;that is to say, three tins of sardines for each
party. I would also give them sufficient money for
one of them, or two, to fall back on the river and
purchase provisions for the entire party. I made them
promise that they should remain in charge of my
baggage, most of which I would leave with them at
that spot, while I, with two men, would go right across
the forest as far as the Madeira River, where I would
endeavour to get fresh men and new provisions.</p>

<p>The men agreed to this. As I could not trust any of
them, I took the precaution to take along with me all my
notebooks and the maps I had made of the entire region
we had crossed, four hundred glass negatives which
I had taken and developed, a number of unexposed
plates, a small camera, my chronometer, one aneroid,
a sextant, a prismatic compass, one other compass, and
a number of other things which were absolutely necessary.
The rest of the baggage I left at that spot. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-294" id="Pg_2-294"></a>[<a href="./images/2-294.png">294</a>]</span>
begged the men to take special care of the packages.
All I asked of them was to prop them up on stones so
that the termites and ants should not destroy my possessions,
and to make a shed with palm leaves so as
to protect the packages as much as possible from the
rain. The men promised to do all this faithfully. We
drew lots as to who were to be the two to accompany
me on the difficult errand across the virgin forest.
Fate selected Filippe the negro and Benedicto, both
terribly ill.</p>

<p>We had no idea whatever what the distance would
be between that point and the Madeira River. It
might take us a few days to get there; it might take us
some months. All the provisions we of the advance
party should have to depend upon were the three tins
of sardines and the tin of anchovies&mdash;the latter had
remained in our possession when we tossed up as to
which of the two parties should have it. The Indian
Miguel was induced at the last moment to come also,
and with him came the carrier his friend.</p>

<p>Early on September 2nd I was ready to start, and
roused poor Filippe and Benedicto, who were in a
shocking state. Without a word of farewell from the
men we left behind, and for whom we were about to
sacrifice our lives perhaps, we started on our dangerous
mission. The Indian Miguel and myself walked in
front, cutting the way all the time, while I held my
compass in hand so as to keep the correct direction
west. Considering all, we marched fairly well.</p>

<p>It was curious to note how difficult it was for men
to travel in a straight line while cutting a way through
the forest. I noticed that the Indian, when cutting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-295" id="Pg_2-295"></a>[<a href="./images/2-295.png">295</a>]</span>
his way through, using the knife in his right hand,
would gradually veer to the right, so that if you let him
go long enough he would describe a regular circle and
come back to his original starting-point. If he cut
the way with the left hand, the tendency would be to
keep to the left all the time until he had described a
circle that way. That was not characteristic of that
man only, but of nearly all the men I met in Brazil
when making a <i>picada</i>. It was therefore necessary to
keep constant watch with the compass so that the
deviation should be as small as possible during the
march.</p>

<p>We had gone but a short distance from camp when
we came to a streamlet of the most delicious water. I
had suffered a great deal from thirst the day before.
We had been so poisoned by the yellow water of the
stream that I did not like to try more experiments at
the marsh where my men insisted on making camp.
So that now I really enjoyed a good drink of the limpid
water. That day we found too much water. On
going 1 kil. farther, about 4 kil. from camp, we found
another wider and equally delicious streamlet, 2 m.
wide. All the streams we met flowed in a northerly
direction.</p>

<p>We walked and walked the entire day, until 6 p.m.,
covering a distance of 26 kil. The Indian Miguel
worried me the whole day, saying that cutting the
<i>picada</i> was heavy work and he could not go on, as his
finger was hurting him, and the pay he received&mdash;&pound;1
sterling a day&mdash;was too small for the work he had to
do. I had to keep constant watch on him, as he was
a man of a slippery nature, and I did not know what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-296" id="Pg_2-296"></a>[<a href="./images/2-296.png">296</a>]</span>
he might do from one moment to another. Also he
said we were simply committing suicide by trying to go
through the virgin forest, as we should meet thousands
of Indians who would attack us, and we had no chance
of escape. I needed this man and his companion to
carry my sextant and the unexposed photographic
plates, some two hundred of them, which were of considerable
weight.</p>

<p>That night, when we made camp, Miguel shot a fine
<i>jac&uacute;</i> (<i>Penelope cristata</i>), and we had a meal. Soon
after a regular downpour came upon us, making us feel
most uncomfortable. At about eight o'clock, however,
the rain stopped. With a great deal of trouble we
were able to light a fire, while the wet leaves of the
trees kept on dropping water on us and making a
peculiar rustling noise on the carpet of dead foliage on
the ground.</p>

<p>By the light of that fire a weird and almost tragic
scene took place. Miguel came up to me, and said in a
dramatic tone that for the sake of his wife and children
I must let him go back, as we were marching to sure
death. If I did not let him go back ... here he
took his forehead between his hands&mdash;"God help me!"
he said, and he burst into tears. He said he did not
wish for his pay, as he had not fulfilled his contract.
Whatever he had on his person he was willing to give
me if I would only let him go back. I said I wished
him to keep all his possessions, and as he did not wish
to go along with me I would certainly let him go back
the next morning. He would then also receive the
pay according to the time he had been with me.
Miguel went back near the fire, where he cried for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-297" id="Pg_2-297"></a>[<a href="./images/2-297.png">297</a>]</span>
time. Accustomed to deal with Brazilians, I perceived
that Miguel thought my promises too good to be true.</p>

<p>When leaving the last camp I had improvised for
myself a kind of hammock with some straps and a
waterproof canvas sheet which I had cut out of one
of my tents. I was lying in that hammock thinking,
when I saw Miguel get up, and, screening his eyes with
his hand, look fixedly my way. I pretended to be
asleep.</p>

<p>Miguel&mdash;who, by the way, was a Christian&mdash;took
the dagger from his waist and walking to a large tree
scratched a cross upon its bark. Then, sticking the
knife with force into the tree, he clasped his hands over
its handle, and bent his head over it, muttering some
prayers. Twice&mdash;perhaps thinking he was being observed&mdash;he
turned round towards me, and when he
did so the expression on his face, lighted by the flickering
flame, was really ghastly.</p>

<p>He prayed for some ten minutes, then, with the
dagger in his hand, he walked cautiously towards my
hammock. He was within 3 metres of me when I jumped
up, seizing Filippe's rifle, which I had placed by my
side in the hammock. With the butt I struck the
Indian a violent blow in the chest.</p>

<p>He stumbled back, dropped his knife and went down
on his knees touching my feet with his trembling
hands and begging my pardon. Again came more
sobs and tears; again more entreaties to be discharged.
I got up and confiscated his rifle and all his cartridges,
as well as the knife, then sent him to his hammock
to sleep. The next morning I would see what I could
do.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-298" id="Pg_2-298"></a>[<a href="./images/2-298.png">298</a>]</span>
I saw clearly that it was no use taking on a man
like that, who added to my other trials somewhat of a
mental strain. The next morning, before sunrise, we
were up again. I gave Miguel and his friend their full
salaries up to date and sent them back. I handed him
his rifle and cartridges, which were his own possessions,
but I kept the knife as a memento.</p>

<p>Even when treating men generously in Brazil you
had always to beware of treachery. I told Miguel and
his friend to walk straight ahead and not turn round.
I warned Miguel not to unsling his rifle from his shoulders
until he had walked half a league. If he did
while still in sight of me I would put a bullet through
him. I said it and I meant it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> departure of those two men added much to our
troubles. I had to abandon at that spot all the
unused photographic plates, my sextant and a large
prismatic compass, half the supply of cartridges we
had taken with us, a pair of extra shoes, and a number
of other things. With our reduced loads we made an
early start, Filippe that day behaving very bravely.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said he; "if all the others are
afraid, I am not. I will follow you anywhere. After
all, nothing can happen to us worse than death. You
have always behaved kindly to me, and I will never
abandon you."</p>

<p>Both Filippe and Benedicto were still poorly, but
the violent exertion of the previous day had done
them good and their condition seemed to have slightly
improved.</p>

<p>We started once more across the virgin forest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-300" id="Pg_2-300"></a>[<a href="./images/2-300.png">300</a>]</span>
directing our steps due west. Filippe this time undertook
to open the <i>picada</i>, while I, compass in hand,
marched directly behind him, Benedicto following me.
Filippe, who was unaccustomed to go through the
forest, was even worse than Miguel for keeping the
correct direction. If I had let him go, he would have
described circle after circle upon himself instead of
going in a straight line.</p>

<p>From that point our march across the forest became
tragic. Perhaps I can do nothing better than reproduce
almost word by word the entries in my diary.</p>

<p>We ate that morning what little there remained
of the <i>mutum</i> we had shot the previous evening. Little
we knew then that we were not to taste fresh meat
again for nearly a month from that date.</p>

<p>During September 3rd we made fairly good progress,
cutting our way through incessantly. We went
that day 20 kil. We had no lunch, and it was only
in the evening that we opened the last of the three small
boxes of sardines, our entire dinner consisting of
three and a half sardines each.</p>

<p>On September 4th we were confronted, soon after
our departure, with a mountainous country with
deep ravines and furrows, most trying for us owing to
their steepness. We went over five ranges of hills from
100 to 300 ft. in height, and we crossed five streamlets
in the depressions between those successive ranges.</p>

<p>Filippe was again suffering greatly from an attack
of fever, and I had to support him all the time, as
he had the greatest difficulty in walking. Benedicto
had that day been entrusted with the big knife for
cutting the <i>picada</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-301" id="Pg_2-301"></a>[<a href="./images/2-301.png">301</a>]</span>
We went some 20 kil. that day, with nothing
whatever to eat, as we had already finished the three
boxes of sardines, and I was reserving the box of
anchovies for the moment when we could stand hunger
no longer.</p>

<p>On September 5th we had another very terrible
march over broken country, hilly for a good portion
of the distance, but quite level in some parts.</p>

<p>The man Benedicto, who was a great eater, now
collapsed altogether, saying that he could no longer
carry his load and could not go on any farther without
food.</p>

<p>The entire day our eyes had roamed in all directions,
trying to discover some wild fruit which was edible,
or some animal we might shoot, but there was the
silence of death all around us. Not a branch, not a
leaf was moved by a living thing; no fruit of any
kind was to be seen anywhere.</p>

<p>Our appetite was keen, and it certainly had one
good effect&mdash;it stopped Filippe's fever and, in fact,
cured it altogether.</p>

<p>The two men were tormenting me the whole day,
saying they had no faith in the compass: how could
a brass box&mdash;that is what they called it&mdash;tell us where
we could find <i>feij&atilde;o</i>? It was beyond them to understand
it. They bemoaned themselves incessantly,
swearing at the day they had been persuaded to come
along with me and leave their happy homes in order
to die of starvation in the forest with a mad Englishman!
And why did we go across the forest at all,
where there was no trail, when we could have gone
down by the river on a trading boat?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-302" id="Pg_2-302"></a>[<a href="./images/2-302.png">302</a>]</span>
On September 6th it was all I could do to wake
up my men. When they did wake, they would not
get up, for they said the only object in getting up
was to eat, and as there was nothing to eat there was
no use in getting up. They wanted to remain there
and die.</p>

<p>I had to use a great deal of gentle persuasion,
and even told them a big story&mdash;that my <i>agulha</i> or
needle (the compass) was telling me that morning
that there was plenty of <i>feij&atilde;o</i> ahead of us.</p>

<p>We struggled on kilometre after kilometre, one or
another of us collapsing under our loads every few
hundred metres. We went over very hilly country,
crossing eight hill ranges that day with steep ravines
between. In fact, all that country must once have
been a low tableland which had been fissured and
then eroded by water, leaving large cracks. At the
bottom of each we found brooks and streamlets
of delicious water. Of the eight rivulets found that
day one only was fairly large. It fell in little cascades
over rock. We could see no fish in its waters.</p>

<p>The forest was fairly clean underneath, and we
had no great difficulty in getting through, a cut every
now and then with the knife being sufficient to make
a passage for us. I had by that time entirely given
up the idea of opening a regular <i>picada</i>, over which
I could eventually take the men and baggage I had left
behind.</p>

<p>We found that day a palm with a bunch of small
nuts which Benedicto called <i>coco do matto</i>; he said
they were delicious to eat, so we proceeded to cut
down the tall palm tree. When we came to split<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-303" id="Pg_2-303"></a>[<a href="./images/2-303.png">303</a>]</span>
open the small <i>cocos</i> our disappointment was great,
for they merely contained water. There was nothing
whatever to eat inside the hard shells. We spent
some two hours that evening cracking the <i>cocos</i>&mdash;some
two hundred of them&mdash;each nut about the size of a
cherry. They were extremely hard to crack, and
our expectant eyes were disappointed two hundred
times in succession as we opened every one and found
nothing whatever to eat in them.</p>

<p>We were beginning to feel extremely weak, with
a continuous feeling of emptiness in our insides.
Personally, I felt no actual pain. The mental strain,
perhaps, was the most trying thing for me, for I had
no idea when we might find food. I was beginning
to feel more than ever the responsibility of taking
those poor fellows there to suffer for my sake. On
their side they certainly never let one moment go
by during the day or night without reminding me of
the fact.</p>

<p>On September 7th I had the greatest difficulty
in getting the men out of their hammocks. They
were so exhausted that I could not rouse them. We
had had a terrific storm during the night, which had
added misery to our other sufferings. Innumerable
ants were now causing us a lot of damage. Filippe's
coat, which had dropped out of his hammock, was
found in the morning entirely destroyed. Those
miniature demons also cut the string to which I had
suspended my shoes in mid-air, and no sooner had
they fallen to the ground than the ants started on
their mischievous work. When I woke up in the
morning all that remained of my shoes were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-304" id="Pg_2-304"></a>[<a href="./images/2-304.png">304</a>]</span>
two leather soles, the upper part having been completely
destroyed.</p>

<p>Going through the forest, where thorns of all
sizes were innumerable, another torture was now
in store for me. With pieces of string I turned the
soles of the shoes into primitive sandals; but when
I started on the march I found that they hurt me
much more than if I walked barefooted. After
marching a couple of kilometres, my renovated foot-gear
hurt me so much in going up and down the
steep ravines that I took off the sandals altogether
and flung them away.</p>

<p>That day we went over eleven successive hill
ranges and crossed as many little streamlets between
them. My men were terribly downhearted. We had with
us a Mauser and two hundred cartridges, but although
we did nothing all day long but look for something
to kill we never heard a sound of a living animal. Only
one day at the beginning of our fast did I see a big
<i>mutum</i>&mdash;larger than a big turkey. The bird had never
seen a human being, and sat placidly perched on the
branch of a tree, looking at us with curiosity, singing
gaily. I tried to fire with the Mauser at the bird,
which was only about seven or eight metres away,
but cartridge after cartridge missed fire. I certainly
spent not less than twenty minutes constantly replenishing
the magazine, and not a single cartridge went
off. They had evidently absorbed so much moisture
on our many accidents in the river and in the heavy
rain-storms we had had of late, that they had become
useless.</p>

<p>While I was pointing the gun the bird apparently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-305" id="Pg_2-305"></a>[<a href="./images/2-305.png">305</a>]</span>
took the greatest interest in my doings, looked at
me, stooping down gracefully each time that the
rifle missed fire, singing dainty notes almost as if it
were laughing at me. The funny part of it all was
that we eventually had to go away disappointed,
leaving the bird perched on that very same branch.</p>

<p>As the days went by and we could find nothing
to eat, my two men lost their courage entirely. They
now refused to suffer any longer. They said they
had not the strength to go back, so they wanted to
lie down and die. Many times a day did I have to
lift them up again and persuade them gently to come
on another few hundred metres or so. Perhaps then
we might find the great river Madeira, where we should
certainly meet traders from whom we could get food.</p>

<p>Filippe the negro was a great smoker. He had
brought some tobacco with him, and he had so far
smoked all the time. He said that as long as he had
a cigarette in his mouth he did not feel the pangs of
hunger quite so much.</p>

<p>Since my return to civilization I have been constantly
told by smokers that if I had been a smoker
too I might have suffered less than I did. Now let
me tell you what happened to smoker Filippe when
his tobacco came to an end on that painful march.
Filippe became a raving lunatic, and in a fit of passion
was about to stick right through his heart the large
knife with which we cut our way through the forest.
I had quite a struggle in order to get the knife away
from him, and an additional strain was placed upon
my mind by keeping a constant watch on the knife
so that it could not be used for suicidal purposes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-306" id="Pg_2-306"></a>[<a href="./images/2-306.png">306</a>]</span>
Poor Benedicto, who was of a less violent nature,
from morning to night implored to be killed. The
two together moaned and groaned incessantly, and
accused me a hundred times a day of taking them
there on purpose to die. They certainly made me
feel the full and heavy weight of our tragic position.
The mental strain of leading along those two poor
fellows was indeed much more trying to me than the
actual lack of food.</p>

<p>In order to save as much as possible of the baggage
we carried, I promised Filippe and Benedicto a considerable
present of money if they were able to take
the stuff until we reached the Madeira River.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of September 7th, as we
were on a high point above the last range of hills
met that day, a large panorama opened before us,
which we could just see between the trees and foliage
of the forest.</p>

<p>To obtain a full view of the scenery it was necessary
to climb up a tree. I knew well that we could not
yet have reached the river we were looking for, but
perhaps we were not far from some large tributary
of the Madeira, such as the Secundury.</p>

<p>Climbing up trees in the Brazilian forest was
easier said than done, even when you possessed your
full strength. So many were the ants of all sizes
which attacked you with fury the moment you embraced
the tree, that it was not easy to get up more
than a few feet.</p>

<p>When we drew lots as to whom of us should climb
the tree, Benedicto was the one selected by fate.
Benedicto was certainly born under an unlucky star;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-307" id="Pg_2-307"></a>[<a href="./images/2-307.png">307</a>]</span>
when anything nasty or unpleasant happened to
anybody it was always to poor Benedicto. After a
lot of pressing he proceeded to go up the tree, uttering
piercing yells as every moment great <i>sauba</i> ants
bit his arms, legs or body. He was brave enough,
and slowly continued his way up until he reached
a height of some 30 ft. above the ground, from which
eminence he gave us the interesting news that there
were some high hills standing before us to the west, while
to the north-west was a great flat surface covered by
dense forest.</p>

<p>No sooner had Benedicto supplied us with this
information from his high point of vantage than we
heard an agonising yell and saw him spread flat on
the ground, having made a record descent.</p>

<p>Filippe and I, although suffering considerably,
were in fits of laughter at Benedicto, who did not
laugh at all, but pawed himself all over, saying he
must have broken some bones. When I proceeded
to examine him I found upon his body over a hundred
<i>sauba</i> ants clinging to his skin with their powerful
clippers.</p>

<p>Aching all over, poor Benedicto got up once more.
I put the load upon his back and we resumed our
journey, making a precipitous descent almost <i>&agrave; pic</i>
down the hill side. Our knees were so weak that
we fell many times and rolled down long distances
on that steep incline. At last we got to the bottom,
rejoicing in our hearts that we had no more hills to
climb, as I had made up my mind that I would now
march slightly to the north-west, so as to avoid the
hilly region which Benedicto had discovered to the west.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-308" id="Pg_2-308"></a>[<a href="./images/2-308.png">308</a>]</span>
My men had an idea that the great river we were
looking for must be in that plain. For a few hours
they seemed to have regained their courage. We
heard some piercing shrieks, and we at once proceeded
in their direction, as we knew they came from monkeys.
In fact we found an enormously high tree, some 5 ft.
in diameter. Up on its summit some beautiful yellow
fruit stared us in the face. Four tiny monkeys were
busy eating the fruit. Benedicto, who had by that
time become very religious, joined his hands and
offered prayers to the Virgin that the monkeys might
drop some fruit down, but they went on eating while
we gazed at them from below. We tried to fire at them
with the Mauser, but again not a single cartridge went
off. Eventually the monkeys dropped down the empty
shells of the fruit they had eaten. With our ravenous
appetite we rushed for them and with our teeth scraped
off the few grains of sweet substance which remained
attached to the inside of the shells. We waited and
waited under that tree for a long time, Filippe now
joining also in the prayers. Each time a shell
dropped our palates rejoiced for a few moments at
the infinitesimal taste we got from the discarded
shells. It was out of the question to climb up such
a big tree or to cut it down, as we had no strength left.</p>

<p>We went on until sunset; my men once more
having lost heart. Brazilians lose heart very easily.
At the sight of small hills before them, a steep descent,
or a deep river to cross, they would lie down and
say they wanted to remain there and die. Filippe
and Benedicto did not carry more than 20 lb. each of
my own baggage, but their hammocks weighed some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-309" id="Pg_2-309"></a>[<a href="./images/2-309.png">309</a>]</span>
20 lb. each, so that their loads weighed altogether
about 40 lb.</p>

<p>We went on, crossing five more streamlets that
afternoon, of which one, 2 m. wide, had beautifully
limpid water. We nevertheless went on, until eventually
after sunset we had to camp near a stream of
filthy water. We did not mind that so much, because,
contrary to the popular idea that while you are starving
you require a great deal of water, I found that during
those days of starvation both my men and myself
hardly ever touched water at all. Personally I am
accustomed to drink only with my meals, and as I
had no meals at all I never had the slightest wish to
drink. My men, however, who while on the river,
for instance, when we had plenty of food, drank
perhaps twenty times a day from the stream, now
that they were starving only seldom touched the
water, and when they did, only in very small quantities.
I do not suppose that my men during the
entire period of starvation drank on an average more
than a wineglass of water a day. Personally I
know that I never drank more than half a tumbler
or less in the twenty-four hours during that time.
Under normal circumstances I drink about a quart
of water a day. The water, I may say, was plentiful
all the time, and, barring a few occasions, such as
on that particular night, most excellent.</p>

<p>As we had now been four entire days without
eating anything at all, I thought it was high time
to open the valuable tin of anchovies&mdash;the only one
in our possession. We had a terrible disappointment
when I opened the tin. I had purchased it in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-310" id="Pg_2-310"></a>[<a href="./images/2-310.png">310</a>]</span>
S. Manoel from Mr. Barretto. To our great distress
we discovered that instead of food it contained merely
some salt and a piece of slate. This was a great blow
to us. The box was a Brazilian counterfeit of a tin
of anchovies. How disheartening to discover the fraud
at so inopportune a moment! I had reserved the
tin until the last as I did not like the look of it
from the outside. We kept the salt&mdash;which was of the
coarsest description.</p>

<p>On September 8th we were slightly more fortunate,
as the country was flatter. I was steering a course
of 290&deg; b.m. (N.W.). I found that farther south we
would have encountered too mountainous a country.</p>

<p>We crossed several streamlets, the largest 3 m.
wide, all of which flowed south. We had no particular
adventure that day, and considering all things,
we marched fairly well&mdash;some 20 kil. Towards the
evening we camped on a hill. When we got there
we were so exhausted that we made our camp on the
summit, although there was no water near.</p>

<p>On September 9th, after marching for half an
hour we arrived at a stream 15 m. wide, which I took
at first to be the river Secundury, a tributary of the
Madeira River. Near the banks of that stream we
found indications that human beings had visited that
spot&mdash;perhaps the Indians we had heard so much about.
The marks we found, however, were, I estimated,
about one year old. Although these signs should
have given us a little courage to go on, we were so
famished and exhausted that my men sat down on
the river bank and would not proceed. By that time
we had got accustomed even to the fierce bites of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-311" id="Pg_2-311"></a>[<a href="./images/2-311.png">311</a>]</span>
ants. We had no more strength to defend ourselves.
In vain we strained our eyes all the time in search
of wild fruit. In the river we saw plenty of fish;
we had a fishing-line with us, but no bait whatever
that we could use. There are, of course, no worms
underground where ants are so numerous. We could
not make snares in the river, as it was much too deep.
So we sat with covetous eyes, watching the fish go
by. It was most tantalising, and made us ten times
more hungry than ever to be so near food and not
be able to get it.</p>

<p>It is curious how hunger works on your brain.
I am not at all a glutton, and never think of food
under ordinary circumstances. But while I was
starving I could see before me from morning till night,
in my imagination, all kinds of delicacies&mdash;caviare,
Russian soups, macaroni au gratin, all kinds of refreshing
ice-creams, and plum pudding. Curiously
enough, some days I had a perfect craving for one
particular thing, and would have given anything I
possessed in the world to obtain a morsel of it. The
next day I did not care for that at all, in my imagination,
but wanted something else very badly. The
three things which I mostly craved for while I was
starving were caviare, galantine of chicken, and ice-cream&mdash;the
latter particularly.</p>

<p>People say that with money you can do anything
you like in the world. I had at that time on my person
some &pound;6,000 sterling, of which &pound;4,000 was in actual
cash. If anybody had placed before me a morsel of
any food I would gladly have given the entire sum
to have it. But no, indeed; no such luck! How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-312" id="Pg_2-312"></a>[<a href="./images/2-312.png">312</a>]</span>
many times during those days did I vividly dream of
delightful dinner and supper parties at the Savoy,
the Carlton, or the Ritz, in London, Paris, and New
York! How many times did I think of the delicious
meals I had had when a boy in the home of my dear
father and mother! I could reconstruct in my
imagination all those meals, and thought what an
idiot I was to have come there out of my own free
will to suffer like that. My own dreams were constantly
interrupted by Benedicto and Filippe, who
also had similar dreams of the wonderful meals they
had had in their own houses, and the wonderful ways
in which their <i>feij&atilde;ozinho</i>&mdash;a term of endearment
used by them for their beloved beans&mdash;had been cooked
at home by their sweethearts or their temporary wives.</p>

<p>"Why did we leave our <i>feij&atilde;ozinho</i>"&mdash;and here
they smacked their lips&mdash;"to come and die in this
rotten country?"</p>

<p>All day I heard them talk of <i>feij&atilde;ozinho</i>, <i>feij&atilde;ozinho</i>,
until I was wearied to distraction by that word&mdash;particularly
as, even when starving, I had no desire
whatever to eat the beastly stuff.</p>

<p>The negro Filippe and Benedicto were really brave
in a way. I tried to induce them all the time to
march as much as we could, so as to get somewhere;
but every few moments they sat or fell down, and
much valuable time was wasted.</p>

<p>In a way it was amusing to watch them&mdash;poor
Benedicto particularly, who every few minutes would
take out a little pocket looking-glass to gaze at his
countenance.</p>

<p>"Am I not thin?" he would ask me a dozen times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-313" id="Pg_2-313"></a>[<a href="./images/2-313.png">313</a>]</span>
a day. "I have never been so thin before. If I
had not come with you I should not be so thin. It
is all because we have no food that I am so thin.... If
I had not met you I would never have been so
thin!"&mdash;and so on all day.</p>

<p>I reminded him that when we were travelling
on the river he had complained of baling the water
out of the canoe and preferred to travel overland;
now that we were travelling overland he had a new
complaint to make. It was quite unreasonable. He
was not the only one to get thin; we were all getting
thin.</p>

<p>Benedicto greatly objected to carry the 15 lb.
weight of glass negatives, but he did not mind at all
carrying a lot of useless things of his own, which
weighed an extra 20 lb. or so!</p>

<p>Since my return I have been constantly asked
why, when we were starving, we did not eat the grass
in the forest; why we did not feed on the leaves or
roots of the trees? If we could find no fruit, why
did not we eat monkeys or birds or other animals?
why did not we dig for worms and feed on them?</p>

<p>As I have already stated, there were no worms
in the forest because of the ants, which allow no insect
to be underground near the surface. As for the grass,
it takes no very intelligent person to see that it cannot
exist under the trees of the tropical forest. If a few
blades of grass are to be found on the edge of streamlets
it does not follow that you can eat them. That
grass is usually poisonous. The same may be said
of the leaves and roots of trees, even admitting that
you could reach the former&mdash;which is not the case,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-314" id="Pg_2-314"></a>[<a href="./images/2-314.png">314</a>]</span>
as the leaves are usually at a great height upon the
trees, and when you are starving you have not the
strength to climb up. It also follows that where
there is no edible fruit there can be no birds or
monkeys, as animals generally have enough sense not
to settle where there is nothing to eat.</p>

<p>Again, even allowing that some rare trees, the
fruit of which was edible, were to be found, it does
not do to lose sight of the fact that you may be
passing under that tree at the season when it is not
bearing fruit, as fruit-trees, even in tropical countries,
do not always bear fruit at a time to suit the convenience
of the passing traveller.</p>

<p>As I have said, the country we were traversing
was there hilly and rocky, and we were cutting across
the headwaters of numerous tributaries, first of the
Tapajoz River, then of the Madeira River&mdash;the tiny
watercourses, most of them only a few inches wide,
descending in numerous successive small cascades
over rocks&mdash;therefore no fish was to be found. When
we did find it in the big rivers we had no way to
catch it.</p>

<p>It then again follows, concerning the country
between great rivers, that where there is no fish, no
game, no fruit, no vegetables, and no possible way
of cultivating the land, there can be no inhabitants.
That was why the great Brazilian forest in that region
was uninhabited by human beings.</p>

<p>It was rather pathetic, looking back on those
days, to think of the small cooking pot I carried during
that time of starvation in hopes that we might find
something to cook. Its weight was not great, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-315" id="Pg_2-315"></a>[<a href="./images/2-315.png">315</a>]</span>
it was a cumbersome thing to carry, as it dangled
about and caught in all the vegetation.</p>

<p>As the days went by and our strength got less
and less every hour, I decided not to cut the forest
any more, but to go through without that extra
exertion. As I could not trust my men with the
big knife, I had to carry it myself, as occasionally it
had to be used&mdash;especially near streams, where the
vegetation was always more or less entangled.</p>

<p>That evening (September 9th) we had halted at
sunset&mdash;simply dead with fatigue and exhaustion.
The <i>sauba</i> ants had cut nearly all the strings of Filippe's
hammock; while he was resting peacefully on it
the remainder of the strings broke, and he had a bad
fall. He was so exhausted that he remained lying
on the ground, swarming all over with ants and
moaning the whole time, having no strength to repair
the hammock.</p>

<p>When Filippe eventually fell into a sound slumber
I had a curious experience in the middle of the night.
I was sleeping in my improvised hammock, when I
felt two paws resting on my body and something
sniffing in my face. When I opened my eyes I found
a jaguar, standing up on its hind paws, staring me
straight in the face. The moment I moved, the
astonished animal, which had evidently never seen a
human being before, leapt away and disappeared.</p>

<p>I find that people have strange ideas about wild
animals. It is far from true that wild beasts are vicious.
I have always found them as gentle as possible. Although
I have seen nearly every wild beast that it is
possible for man to see in the world, I have never once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-316" id="Pg_2-316"></a>[<a href="./images/2-316.png">316</a>]</span>
been attacked by them, although on dozens of occasions
I have come into close contact with them. I invariably
found all wild animals&mdash;<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'expect'">except</ins> the African
buffalo&mdash;quite timid and almost gentle, unless, of
course, they have been worried or wounded. These
remarks do not apply to wild animals in captivity.</p>

<p>On September 10th&mdash;that was the seventh day of
our involuntary fast&mdash;we had another dreary march,
again without a morsel of food. My men were so downhearted
that I really thought they would not last much
longer. Hunger was playing on them in a curious
way. They said that they could hear voices all round
them and people firing rifles. I could hear nothing
at all. I well knew that their minds were beginning
to go, and that it was a pure hallucination. Benedicto
and Filippe, who originally were both atheists of an
advanced type, had now become extremely religious,
and were muttering fervent prayers all the time.
They made a vow that if we escaped alive they would
each give &pound;5 sterling out of their pay to have a big
mass celebrated in the first church they saw.</p>

<p>They spoke in a disconnected way, and looked
about in a dazed condition, alternating hysterical
laughter with abundant tears. After Filippe's tobacco
had come to an end he had become most dejected, all
the time wishing to commit suicide.</p>

<p>"What is the use of more suffering?" he exclaimed
fifty times a day. "Let me die quickly, as
I can stand the pain no more!" Then all of a sudden
his eyes would shine, he would prick up his ears,
crying: "We are near people!&mdash;we are near people!
I can hear voices! Let us fire three shots" (the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-317" id="Pg_2-317"></a>[<a href="./images/2-317.png">317</a>]</span>
signal all over Central Brazil of an approaching
stranger or of help required), "so that people can
come to our assistance!"</p>

<p>That was much easier said than done, because
none of our cartridges would go off. We had one box
of matches left. We had taken several boxes of
them, but Filippe had used them all in lighting his
cigarettes, and we had only one left, which I guarded
with much care. To please my men we lighted a
big fire, and in it we placed a number of cartridges
so that they should explode. In fact some of them
actually did explode, and my men strained their
ears in order to discover responding sounds. But
no sounds came, although they imagined they could
hear all kinds of noises.</p>

<p>At this place I abandoned the few cartridges we
had, as they were absolutely useless. They were
Mauser cartridges which I had bought in Rio de Janeiro,
and it is quite possible that they were counterfeits.</p>

<p>Taking things all round, my men behaved very
well, but these were moments of the greatest anxiety
for me, and I myself was praying fervently to God
to get us out of that difficulty. My strength was
failing more and more daily, and although I was
suffering no actual pain, yet the weakness was simply
appalling. It was all I could do to stand up on my
legs. What was worse for me was that my head was
still in good working order, and I fully realised our
position all the time.</p>

<p>The country we were travelling over was fairly
hilly, up and down most of the time, over no great
elevations. We passed two large tributaries of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-318" id="Pg_2-318"></a>[<a href="./images/2-318.png">318</a>]</span>
main stream we had found before, and a number of
minor ones. The main stream was strewn with fallen
trees, and was not navigable during the dry season.
The erosion of the banks by the water had caused
so many trees to fall down across it that no canoe
could possibly go through.</p>

<p>I noticed in one or two places along the river
traces of human beings having been there some years
before.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we again wasted much energy
in knocking down two palm-trees on the summit of
which were great bunches of <i>coco do matto</i>. Again
we had a bitter disappointment. One after the other
we split the nuts open, but they merely contained
water inside shells that were much harder to crack
than wood. My craving for food was such that
in despair I took two or three <i>sauba</i> ants and
proceeded to eat them. When I ground them under
my teeth their taste was so acidly bitter that it made
me quite ill. Not only that, but one <i>sauba</i> bit my
tongue so badly that it swelled up to a great size,
and remained like that for several days. The entire
genus of the Sauba (<i>&#338;codonia cephalotes</i>) ant is typical
of tropical South America. The largest Sauba is
about an inch long, and possesses powerful scissor-like
clippers, with which it can destroy any material,
such as leather, cloth, paper or leaves, in a very short
time. Their method of work is to cut up everything
into circles. I remember one day dropping on the
ground a pair of thick gloves. When I went to pick
them up I found them reduced to a heap of innumerable
little discs&mdash;each as large as a sixpenny coin. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-319" id="Pg_2-319"></a>[<a href="./images/2-319.png">319</a>]</span>
with those powerful clippers that the Saubas, having
climbed in swarms up a tree, proceed to despoil it of
its foliage. The work is done in a systematic way,
each ant quickly severing one leaf and carrying it down,
banner-like, vertically above its head, tightly held
between its strong mandibles.</p>

<p>It is this habit of the Saubas which has brought
upon them the Brazilian name of <i>Carregadores</i>, or
carriers. One sees everywhere in that country long
processions of those destructive insects, each individual
marching along quickly with its green
vegetable banner, sometimes eight or ten times its
own size and weight. In many cases the Saubas
working aloft cut the leaves and drop them on the
ground, where other carriers are waiting to convey
them away. So numerous are the Saubas that in the
forest one can hear distinctly the incessant rustling
sound of their clippers at work. The Saubas use
the leaves in order to construct thatched waterproof
roofs over the domes and turrets at the entrances of
their extensive subterranean galleries, which would
otherwise become flooded during the torrential rains
prevalent in those latitudes. The roofs are constructed
with wonderful skill, each leaf being held in its place
by granules of earth. The galleries, of immense
length and much ramified, are often as much as 10
to 15 cm. in diameter. The entrances to them
are usually kept blocked, and are only opened when
necessary. Above ground the Saubas make wonderful
wide roads, thousands of which can be seen everywhere
in the forest, and upon which endless processions go
by day and night. The workers of the Saubas can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-320" id="Pg_2-320"></a>[<a href="./images/2-320.png">320</a>]</span>
divided into three orders not very clearly defined, as
units of intermediate grades are constantly met. The
largest of those workers possess extraordinarily massive,
double-humped heads, highly polished in the case of
members which are visible on the surface, and dull
and hairy in the giant fellows which spend their lives
within the subterranean passages. These hairy Saubas
display a single frontal eye&mdash;not found in any of the
other Saubas, and, as far as I know, in no other kind
of ant. They never come to the surface except when
attacks are made upon the galleries. Great excitement
is shown in the colonies when the winged ants, of
extra large size&mdash;especially the females&mdash;start out on
their errand of propagating the race.</p>

<p>The workers with polished heads&mdash;fierce-looking
brutes&mdash;do very little actual work, but seem to be
the superiors and protectors of the smaller workers.
In every case the body of all orders of Saubas is solidly
built, with the thorax and head protected by spikes.</p>

<p>Much as I disliked the Saubas for the endless
trouble and suffering they inflicted upon me, I could
not help admiring their marvellous industry and
energy. No agriculture is possible where the Saubas
are to be found, and even where they do not exist
in Central Brazil, if agriculture were started they
would soon invade the territory and destroy everything
in a short time. Foreign plants do not escape. No
way has been found yet of extirpating them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> September 11th we had another terrible march,
the forest being very dense and much entangled along
the stream. We had great trouble in getting through,
as there were many palms and ferns, and we had no
more strength to cut down our way. We came to
a big tree, which was hollow inside up to a great
height, and round which were millions of bees.</p>

<p>Benedicto, who was a great connoisseur in such
matters, said that high up inside the tree there must
be honey. The bees round that tree were unfortunately
stinging bees. We drew lots as to who should go
inside the tree to get the honey. It fell to Benedicto.
We took off most of our clothes and wrapped up his
head and legs so that he might proceed to the attack.
The job was not an easy one, for in the first reconnaissance
he made with his head inside the tree he
discovered that the honey must be not less than 20 ft.
above the ground, and it was necessary to climb up
to that height inside the tree before he could get it.
In order to hasten matters&mdash;as Benedicto was reluctant
in carrying out the job&mdash;I tried my hand at it, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-322" id="Pg_2-322"></a>[<a href="./images/2-322.png">322</a>]</span>
I was stung badly by hundreds of bees behind my
head, on my eyelids, on my arms and legs. When I
came out of the tree I was simply covered with angry
bees, which stung me all over. So I told Benedicto
that, as Fate had called upon him to do the work, he
had better do it.</p>

<p>Benedicto was certainly very plucky that day. All
of a sudden he dashed inside the tree and proceeded
to climb up. We heard wild screams for some minutes;
evidently the bees were protecting their home well.
While Filippe and I were seated outside, smiling faintly
at poor Benedicto's plight, he reappeared. We hardly
recognized him when he emerged from the tree, so
badly stung and swollen was his face, notwithstanding
the protection he had over it. All he brought back
was a small piece of the honeycomb about as large
as a florin. What little honey there was inside was
quite putrid, but we divided it into three equal parts
and devoured it ravenously, bees and all. A moment
later all three of us were seized with vomiting, so
that the meagre meal was worse than nothing to us.</p>

<p>We were then in a region of innumerable liane,
which hung from the trees and caught our feet and
heads, and wound themselves round us when we tried
to shift them from their position. Nearly all the
trees in that part had long and powerful spikes. Then
near water there were huge palms close together,
the sharp-edged leaves of which cut our hands, faces
and legs as we pushed our way through.</p>

<p>A violent storm broke out in the afternoon. The
rain was torrential, making our march extremely
difficult. It was just like marching under a heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-323" id="Pg_2-323"></a>[<a href="./images/2-323.png">323</a>]</span>
shower-bath. The rain lasted for some three hours.
We crossed one large stream flowing west into the
Secundury, and also two other good-sized streamlets.</p>

<p>We had a miserable night, drenched as we were
and unable to light a fire, the box of matches having
got wet and the entire forest being soaked by the
torrential storm. During the night another storm
arrived and poured regular buckets of water upon
us.</p>

<p>On September 12th we drowsily got up from our
hammocks in a dejected state. By that time we had
lost all hope of finding food, and no longer took the
trouble to look round for anything to eat. We went
on a few hundred metres at a time, now Benedicto
fainting from exhaustion, then Filippe, then myself.
While one or another was unconscious much time
was wasted. Marching under those conditions was
horrible, as either one or other of us collapsed every
few hundred metres.</p>

<p>Another violent storm broke out, and we all lay
on the ground helpless, the skin of our hands and feet
getting shrivelled up with the moisture.</p>

<p>My feet were much swollen owing to the innumerable
thorns which had got into them while walking
barefooted. It was most painful to march, as I was
not accustomed to walk without shoes.</p>

<p>We went only ten kilometres on September 12th.
We crossed two small rivers and one large, flowing
west and south, evidently into the Secundury.</p>

<p>On September 13th we had another painful march,
my men struggling along, stumbling and falling every
little while. They were dreadfully depressed. Towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-324" id="Pg_2-324"></a>[<a href="./images/2-324.png">324</a>]</span>
the evening we came to a big tree, at the foot of which
we found some discarded shells, such as we had once
seen before, of fruit eaten by monkeys. My men and I
tried to scrape with our teeth some of the sweet substance
which still adhered to the shells. We saw
some of the fruit, which was fit to eat, at a great height
upon the tree, but we had not the strength to climb
up or cut down that enormous tree.</p>

<p>All the visions of good meals which I had had
until then had now vanished altogether on that tenth
day of fasting, and I experienced a sickly feeling in my
inside which gave me an absolute dislike for food of
any kind. My head was beginning to sway, and I
had difficulty in collecting my ideas. My memory
seemed to be gone all of a sudden. I could no longer
remember in what country I was travelling, nor could
I remember anything distinctly. Only some lucid
intervals came every now and then, in which I realised
our tragic position; but those did not last long,
all I could remember being that I must go to the
west. I could not remember why nor where I intended
to come out.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be against us. We were
there during the height of the rainy season. Towards
sunset rain came down once more in bucketfuls and
lasted the entire night, the water dripping from our
hammocks as it would from a small cascade. We were
soaked, and shivering, although the temperature was
not low. I had my maximum and minimum thermometers
with me, but my exhaustion was such that
I had not the strength to unpack them every night
and morning and set them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-325" id="Pg_2-325"></a>[<a href="./images/2-325.png">325</a>]</span>
We crossed two streamlets flowing west. Benedicto
and Filippe were in such a bad way that it was
breaking my heart to look at them. Every time
they fell down in a faint I never knew whether it
was for the last time that they had closed their eyes.
When I felt their hearts with my hand they beat so
faintly that once or twice I really thought they were
dead. That day I myself fainted, and fell with the
left side of my face resting on the ground. When I
recovered consciousness some time later, I touched
my face, which was hurting me, and found that nearly
the whole skin of my cheek had been eaten up by
small ants, the lower lid of the eye having suffered
particularly. A nasty sore remained on my face for
some two months after that experience, the bites of
those ants being very poisonous.</p>

<p>Bad as they were, there is no doubt that to a
great extent we owed our salvation to those terrible
ants. Had it not been for them and the incessant
torture they inflicted on us when we fell down upon
the ground, we should have perhaps lain there and
never got up again.</p>

<p>I offered Benedicto and Filippe a large reward if
they continued marching without abandoning the
precious loads. Brazilians have a great greed for
money, and for it they will do many things which
they would not do otherwise.</p>

<p>On September 14th we made another most painful
march of 20 kil., again up and down high hills, some
as much as 300 ft. above the level land of that country,
and all with steep, indeed, almost vertical, sides,
extremely difficult for us to climb in our exhausted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-326" id="Pg_2-326"></a>[<a href="./images/2-326.png">326</a>]</span>
condition. We saw several streamlets flowing west.
When evening came we had before us a high hill, which
we ascended. When we reached the top we just
lay upon the ground like so many corpses, and, ants,
or no ants biting us, we had not the energy to get
up again. Once more did the rain come down in
torrents that night, and to a certain extent washed
the ants from our bodies.</p>

<p>My surprise was really great the next morning
when I woke up. I felt myself fading away fast.
Every time I closed my eyes I expected never to
open them again.</p>

<p>On September 15th we made another trying march,
collapsing under our loads every few hundred metres.
My men were constantly looking for something to eat
in all directions, but could find nothing. Benedicto
and Filippe were now all the time contemplating
suicide. The mental strain of perpetually keeping an
eye on them was great.</p>

<p>We were sitting down, too tired to get up, when
Filippe amazed me considerably by the following
words, which he spoke in a kind of reverie:</p>

<p>"It would be very easy," he said, "now that you
have no more strength yourself, for us two to get
the big knife and cut your throat. We know that
you have a big, big sum of money upon you, and if
we robbed you we would be rich for ever. But we
do not want to do it. It would not be much use
to us, as we could not get out of the forest alone.
I believe we shall all die together, and all that money
will go to waste."</p>

<p>Filippe said this in quite a good-natured manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-327" id="Pg_2-327"></a>[<a href="./images/2-327.png">327</a>]</span>
The two poor fellows were so depressed that one had
to forgive them for anything they said.</p>

<p>As the river seemed to describe a big loop, I had
left it three days before, seeing plainly by the conformation
of the country that we should strike it
again sooner or later. We were marching once more
by compass. My men, who had no faith whatever
in the magnetic needle, were again almost paralysed
with fear that we might not encounter the stream
again. A thousand times a day they accused me of
foolishness in leaving the river, as they said it would
have been better to follow its tortuous course&mdash;notwithstanding
the trouble we had in following it, owing
to the dense vegetation near the water&mdash;rather than
strike once more across country. They were beginning
to lose heart altogether, when I told them I
could see by the vegetation that we were once more
near the water. Anybody accustomed as I am to
marching through the forest could tell easily by the
appearance of the vegetation some miles before actually
getting to a stream.</p>

<p>I reassured my companions, saying that within a
few hours we should certainly meet the "big water"
again. In fact, not more than half an hour afterwards
we suddenly found ourselves once more on the
large stream&mdash;at that point 70 metres wide.</p>

<p>My men were so amazed and delighted that they
embraced me and sobbed over my shoulders for some
time. From that moment their admiration for the
compass was unbounded; they expected me to find
anything with it.</p>

<p>With gladdened hearts we followed the stream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-328" id="Pg_2-328"></a>[<a href="./images/2-328.png">328</a>]</span>
again, Benedicto and Filippe shouting at the top of
their voices for help in case anybody were near. But
they called and called in vain. We listened, but not
a sound could be heard, except perhaps that of a
crashing tree in the forest&mdash;a sound very familiar
when marching across Brazil.</p>

<p>The right bank of the Secundury river was high,
not less than from 30 to 40 ft., and extremely steep,
formed of alluvial deposits with a thick surface layer
of decayed vegetation, making a soft carpet. Two
small tributary streams had cut deep grooves in the
soft earth. In our weak condition we had the greatest
trouble in going down the almost vertical banks and
climbing up again on the other side.</p>

<p>On September 16th we followed the river once
more, crossing three tributaries, the largest of which
was 4 m. wide. The forest was beautifully clean
underneath, just like a well-kept park. The stems
of the trees were as clean as possible up to a great
height, the foliage forming a regular roof over us
through which little light and only exhausted air
penetrated.</p>

<p>Although we could find nothing whatever to eat,
my men were not so depressed that day, as they
expected to find some living people sooner or later.
I did not like to disappoint them, although the fact
that we could find no signs of human creatures having
recently gone through that region showed me plainly
that we were yet far away from salvation.</p>

<p>Another formidable rainstorm came down upon
us in the morning, the water descending in regular
sheets. We were so exhausted that we did not care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-329" id="Pg_2-329"></a>[<a href="./images/2-329.png">329</a>]</span>
for anything any more. Whether we got wet or
dry was quite immaterial to us.</p>

<p>I was so conscious of my utmost exhaustion that
I felt I could not now last much longer under
that heavy strain. Every fifty or a hundred metres I
collapsed under my load, and had the greatest struggle
to get up on my feet again. Those marches were
most tragic, my men being, if possible, in a worse
condition than me, they, too, collapsing every few
steps. Thus in a day we each collapsed dozens of
times. That was the thirteenth day we had had no
food whatever, barring perhaps a grain of salt from
the fraudulent anchovy tin, which I had preserved
in a piece of paper.</p>

<p>I felt no actual pain, only great emptiness in my
inside, and a curious feeling of nausea, with no wish
whatever to eat or to drink. Although water was
plentiful we hardly touched it at all&mdash;only a few
drops to moisten our feverish lips. That fact interested
me greatly, as it was absolutely contrary to people's
notions of what happens when you are starving. All
I experienced was indescribable exhaustion. I felt
myself gradually extinguishing like a burnt-out lamp.</p>

<p>Benedicto and Filippe had dreadful nightmares
during the night, and occasionally gave frantic yells.
That night Filippe all of a sudden startled us crying
out for help; a moment later he collapsed in a faint.
When he recovered I asked him what was the matter;
he said in a dazed way that there were people all
round us bringing plenty of food to us&mdash;an hallucination
which was soon dispelled when he returned to his
senses.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-330" id="Pg_2-330"></a>[<a href="./images/2-330.png">330</a>]</span>
On September 17th we had another painful march
without finding a grain of food to eat. Again we
started our day with a severe thunderstorm, the water
coming down upon us in bucketfuls. Benedicto and
Filippe were fervently praying the Almighty to strike
them down by lightning so as to end the daily torture.</p>

<p>The strain of leading those fellows on was getting
almost too much for me. The greatest gentleness had
to be employed, as an angry word would have finished
them altogether, and they would have laid down to die.</p>

<p>The rain came down in such torrents that day,
and we were so soaked, that we had to halt, we three
huddling together to try and protect ourselves under
the waterproof sheet which I used at night as a
hammock. When we went on I noticed a cut in a
tree which had been made some years before. I soon
discovered the tracks which had been followed by the
person who had made that cut, and soon after I discovered
another mark of a knife upon another rubber
tree. Evidently somebody had been there prospecting.
We followed the ancient track for some distance in
a most winding way&mdash;those marks, I judged, having
been made about four years before.</p>

<p>My men were depressed to the utmost degree
when, on following the track of the stranger, we discovered
the spot on the river where he had evidently
once more got into his canoe and gone. One more
hope of salvation shattered!</p>

<p>Curiously enough, upon that fourteenth day of
starving my strength got up again to a certain extent,
although I still had no wish whatever to eat; but my
head began to swim with a strange sensation as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-331" id="Pg_2-331"></a>[<a href="./images/2-331.png">331</a>]</span>
the trees of the forest were tumbling down upon me.
The impression was so vivid that several times I fell
in trying to avoid what I thought was a tree falling
upon me.</p>

<p>The swaying of my head seemed to get worse and
worse all that day, until the unpleasant sensation of
the forest closing in and overwhelming me became
intolerable.</p>

<p>In the evening we came in for another storm, the
rain being torrential through nearly the entire night.
During the day I had had the optical illusion of
trees falling upon me. During the night I had the
real thing. The upper part of the tree to which I
had tied my hammock came down with a terrific
crash during a heavy gust of wind, and just missed
my head by a few inches. As it was it tore down
my hammock with me inside it, and I received a
bump that I shall not forget in a hurry.</p>

<p>We certainly seemed to have no luck whatever on
that fateful expedition! Aching all over, soaked
right through, water dripping down my hands, nose
and hair like so many little fountains, I proceeded to
tie my hammock to another tree, while poor Filippe
and Benedicto, who had been caught in the foliage
and branches of the falling tree, were trying to disentangle
themselves from their unpleasant position.
The tree had fallen because it had been eaten up
internally by ants. When it came down upon us
they simply swarmed over us, and bit us all over for
all they were worth. I have no wish whatever to
have another such miserable night.</p>

<p>On September 18th we lost the whole morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-332" id="Pg_2-332"></a>[<a href="./images/2-332.png">332</a>]</span>
owing to the torrential rain which continued. We
had not the strength to go on.</p>

<p>Now that Filippe and Benedicto had absolute
faith in my compass, I had again left the river where
it described a big turn toward the south-west, and
it was not until two o'clock that afternoon that I
struck the big stream once more and we followed its
right bank.</p>

<p>To our great delight we came to a small clearing
where some years before <i>mandioca</i> had been cultivated.
We threw down our loads at once and proceeded to
search for roots. To our great joy we found one
small root, about as big as a small carrot. We made
a fire. Oh! the anxiety in lighting up that fire, as
we only had eight matches left, and they had got
damp.</p>

<p>Filippe, who was the expert in striking matches,
was entrusted with the job. Alas! he struck and
struck time after time the first match against the box
until its head was worn off altogether, and no flame
was produced. With some anxiety we watched the
second match having a similar fate.</p>

<p>The men said that the root we had found was of
wild <i>mandioca</i>, and if we ate it raw we should certainly
all die, but if roasted properly over a flame it lost some
of its poisonous qualities. We all had our eyes fixed
on that root, and felt the happiest of mortals, as if
the most expensive banquet had all of a sudden been
placed before us. It was a great relief when Filippe
struck the third match and it actually produced
a flame. We lighted a fire, roasting the valuable
root upon it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-333" id="Pg_2-333"></a>[<a href="./images/2-333.png">333</a>]</span>
Benedicto, who was the culinary expert, roasted
the root until it was nearly carbonized, and by the
time he took it out of the flame we had each of us left
for our share a section of its fibrous core not larger
than a well-smoked cigarette stump.</p>

<p>We devoured that luxurious meal in haste. It
tasted as bitter as aloes. No sooner had I eaten it
than I felt extremely ill, my men also experiencing
a similar sensation. Benedicto was the first one to
vomit painfully and cough violently; then came my
turn, then Filippe's. So our first meal was not much
of a success.</p>

<p>The little strength we had seemed now to have
disappeared altogether. We lay helpless upon the
bank of the river, unable to move. Once or twice
Filippe shouted for help, thinking that our voices
might be heard, but no answer ever came to our cries.</p>

<p>Eventually we proceeded once more along the
right bank of the river, when we perceived on the
opposite bank an abandoned hut. The river at that
point was 70 m. wide, from 4 to 5 ft. deep, with a
fairly strong current. We decided to cross over and
see if perhaps by chance some food had been abandoned
in the hut. It was already evening, and we were
so exhausted that we did not dare to cross the stream,
especially as Filippe and Benedicto could not swim.</p>

<p>The next day, September 19th, we proceeded to
ford the stream, having scarcely the strength to keep
erect, especially in the middle of the river with the
water up to our necks. We were carrying our loads
on our heads, so that they should not get wetter than
possible. My negatives were fortunately in air-tight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-334" id="Pg_2-334"></a>[<a href="./images/2-334.png">334</a>]</span>
cases, or else they certainly would have been destroyed
altogether on that disastrous march across the forest.</p>

<p>We got safely to the other side. The bank was
very high. A broken-down canoe had been left on
the shore. We worked many hours trying to mend
her so that we could proceed down the river. But
we wasted the entire day, working feverishly for six
or seven hours, trying to stop up great holes as big as
my fist, one sleeve of my coat being used for the
purpose, and replacing a plank at her stern which was
missing.</p>

<p>When we at length summoned our last atom of
strength to launch her, she immediately filled with
water and went to the bottom like a piece of lead.
That was the end of the canoe. We had not the
strength to float her again.</p>

<p>Building a raft was impossible, as no wood was
found that floated. In reconnoitring round the hut,
to our great joy we discovered some <i>caju</i> and some
<i>guyaba</i> trees; also some more roots of <i>mandioca</i> now
become wild.</p>

<p>That was our sixteenth day of fasting, and it
can well be imagined how quickly we devoured what
little unripe fruit was hanging from the trees. Once
more we tried the experiment of cooking the <i>mandioca</i>
roots. We had now only five matches left. It was
curious to note with what care we prepared dried
wood and leaves so that no chance would be lost in
getting a flame. Fortunately the first match struck
did its work well, and we soon had a big fire inside the
hut, on which we roasted the <i>mandioca</i>.</p>

<p>As I have explained elsewhere, the fruit of the <i>caju</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-335" id="Pg_2-335"></a>[<a href="./images/2-335.png">335</a>]</span>
has an outward nut which has highly caustic properties,
and is deadly poisonous to eat uncooked but quite
edible when roasted. After eating all the fruit we
kept those nuts and put them on the fire; in the
evening we sat down to what seemed to us a luxuriant
meal.</p>

<p>We had not patience to wait for the <i>caju</i> nuts
to be properly roasted. When I ate them my nose,
lips, tongue and fingers became badly burned by their
caustic juice. No sooner had we eaten that meal
than we all became violently ill. I dropped down
unconscious, rejecting everything and quantities of
blood besides. I must have been unconscious many
hours, after which I slept soundly till the sun was
well up in the sky, when I found myself resting on
the ground with a pool of blood by my side. Poor
Filippe and Benedicto were also in a bad way.</p>

<p>On the front of that hut on a piece of board was
written "El Paraiso" (Paradise), the name of that
place. It was not exactly my idea of Heaven.</p>

<p>Our first meals were worse than no meals at all.
We felt in such a plight that we lay helpless upon the
floor of the hut, quite unable to move, so exhausted
were we. In turning my head around I discovered
ten large demijohns, some 2&frac12; ft. high and about 2 ft.
in diameter, of thick green glass. They were the
usual demijohns&mdash;<i>garaffons</i>, as they are called&mdash;used
all over Brazil for "fire-water." I at once conceived
the idea of using them as floats in the construction
of a raft.</p>

<p>My men grinned contemptuously at the idea when
I mentioned it to them. They said that all was over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-336" id="Pg_2-336"></a>[<a href="./images/2-336.png">336</a>]</span>
It was no use trying to get away. The Almighty
wanted us to die, and we must only lie there and
await our end, which was not far off. Benedicto
struggled to his knees and prayed to the Almighty
and the Virgin, sobbing bitterly all the time.</p>

<p>I struggled up on my feet and proceeded to carry
the big vessels to the river bank, where I intended to
construct the raft. The effort to take each heavy bottle
those few metres seemed almost beyond me in my exhausted
state. At last I proceeded to strip the floor of
the hut, which had been made with split <i>assahy</i> palms
(<i>Euterpe oleracea</i> L.), in order that I might make a
frame to which I could fasten the bottles. With a
great deal of persuasion I got Filippe and Benedicto
to help me. The long pieces of <i>assahy</i> were too heavy
for our purpose, and we had the additional trouble
of splitting each piece into four. It was most
trying work in our worn-out condition. Then we had
to go into the forest and collect some small liane,
so that we could tie the pieces together, as we had no
nails and no rope.</p>

<p>On September 20th, again without food&mdash;for we
had eaten up all the fruit the previous day&mdash;we worked
from morning till night in building the raft. Unfortunately,
Benedicto stumbled against one of the
bottles, which was on the edge of the river; it rolled
down the steep bank and floated quickly down stream,
and we saw it disappear, unable to go and recover it.
So only nine bottles were left.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-336.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-336_th.jpg" alt="Raft constructed by the Author in order to navigate the Canuma River with his Two Companions of Starvation." title="Raft constructed by the Author in order to navigate the Canuma River with his Two Companions of Starvation." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Raft constructed by the Author in order to navigate the Canuma River with his Two Companions of Starvation.</p>
<hr />
<p>I made the raft of a triangular shape, with two
parallel diagonal rows of three bottles each at a
distance of 3 ft. apart; then one set of two bottles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-337" id="Pg_2-337"></a>[<a href="./images/2-337.png">337</a>]</span>
One single <i>garaffon</i> formed the bow of the raft.
Naturally I stopped up the necks of the bottles, so
that no water should get inside.</p>

<p>While I was constructing the raft I was all the
time wondering whether it would have a sufficient
floating capacity to carry us three men and our baggage.</p>

<p>When the raft was finished we placed two parallel
pieces of <i>assahy</i> from one end to the other, on which
we could sit astride, with our legs dangling in the
water.</p>

<p>The lassitude with which we did our work and
tore down part of the hut in order to build that raft,
our only way of salvation, was too pitiful to watch.
We absolutely had no strength at all. When we
pulled the liane to fasten together the different pieces
of palm wood we were more exhausted than if we
had lifted a weight of 200 lb. As it was, we could
not fasten the pieces of wood properly, and when the
raft was finished it was indeed a shaky affair.</p>

<p>By sunset on September 20th the raft&mdash;strengthened
by sundry knots all over&mdash;was ready to be launched.
I was more proud of her than if I had built a Dreadnought.
There we all sat by the side of her, my men
looking at her in a sceptical way, saying that it was
just as well, perhaps, to try and die drowned instead
of dying of starvation.</p>

<p>We took a last glance around to see if we could
discover some other fruit or something to eat, but
we found nothing. We postponed the launching of
our vessel&mdash;which I named the <i>Victory</i>&mdash;until the
next morning, as had she perchance had an accident
that night&mdash;accidents at night seem so much worse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-338" id="Pg_2-338"></a>[<a href="./images/2-338.png">338</a>]</span>
than in the daytime&mdash;it would have been too severe
a blow for us, from which we never could have recovered.</p>

<p>My feet were in such a terrible condition&mdash;so full
of thorns, so swollen with numberless <i>jiggers</i> which
had bored channels under my nails and under the
soles&mdash;that I really felt I could not walk another step.
If that raft did not float I knew that we were lost
for good.</p>

<p>The entire night I could not sleep, speculating on
whether the raft would float or not. As far as I
could judge, she seemed to me to have just capacity
enough to keep afloat with all of us on board.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> September 21st my men had a great discussion.
Their courage failed altogether, as they said they
had never before seen a boat of that kind, made of
glass bottles, and that, even allowing that she would
float at all, if we struck a rock where should we be?
They declared that, tired as they were, they preferred
to go on struggling on foot through the forest
rather than get drowned. With his peculiar reasoning,
Benedicto said that it was bad enough to die of starvation,
but to die of starvation and get drowned as
well was too much for him!</p>

<p>It was decided that we should first of all try
whether the raft would bear our weight or not. If
she did, we would sail in her. If she did not, I would
navigate her and they might go on foot.</p>

<p>It was a moment of great excitement and suspense
when we launched the <i>Victory</i>. You should have
seen the faces of Benedicto and Filippe when she
floated on the water as gracefully as a duck. I got
on her, and with a punting pole went half-way across
the river and back again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-340" id="Pg_2-340"></a>[<a href="./images/2-340.png">340</a>]</span>
Filippe and Benedicto, who had hardly recovered
from their astonishment, professed that it was the
cleverest thing they had ever seen, and no Brazilian
ever would have had such a brilliant idea. They were
now anxious to get on board.</p>

<p>First Filippe came and sat himself in front of me,
and I saw with some concern the raft sink down
considerably into the water. When Benedicto also
entered, the framework of our vessel absolutely disappeared
under water and only the short necks of
the bottles showed above the surface. As we sat
astride on the narrow longitudinal platform we were
knee-deep in water. We took another small trip in
mid-stream, and then decided that we would put the
baggage on board and start at once on our journey
down the river.</p>

<p>I went back for the baggage and rolled it all up
in the waterproof hammock, then fastened it with
pieces of liane to the stern of the raft. Filippe and
Benedicto fastened their own things also. Having
made ourselves some primitive-looking paddles with
the bottom of a small empty barrel we had found,
which we attached to two sticks, we made ready to
start.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-340a.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-340a_th.jpg" alt="Canoe made of the Bark of the Burity Palm." title="Canoe made of the Bark of the Burity Palm." /></a></p>

<hr />
<p>Filippe and I had already got on board, when
Benedicto appeared with a huge punting pole he had
cut himself in case we might need it. He was excited
over the prospect of having no more walking to do.
When he got near he jumped on board so clumsily
that the already too heavily laden raft turned over
and we were all flung into the water&mdash;there 7 ft. deep.
When I came to the surface again I just managed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-341" id="Pg_2-341"></a>[<a href="./images/2-341.png">341</a>]</span>
to pull the craft ashore and then proceeded to save
Benedicto and Filippe, who were struggling in the
water, which was too deep for them.</p>

<p>This mishap was unfortunate. My chronometer
got full of water and stopped; the aneroids, the
camera, all were injured beyond repair. Much to my
distress, I also discovered that the watertight cases,
which had been knocked about so much of late, had
let the water through before I had time to turn the
raft the right way up and pull out of the water the
baggage which was fastened to it. The four hundred
developed negatives had all got soaked. My note-books,
too, were drenched through.</p>

<p>Another heavy task was before me now, in order
to save all that valuable material. It was to spread
everything to dry thoroughly in the wind before it
could be packed again.</p>

<p>Filippe and Benedicto were so scared that on no
account, they said, would they go on board that raft
again. The accident occurred at about nine o'clock
in the morning; by one or two o'clock in the afternoon
everything was dry and carefully repacked.</p>

<p>We decided to make a fresh start. My feet were
so swollen, and with hardly a patch of skin left on
them, that I could walk no more. It was agreed
that Filippe and Benedicto should go on walking
along the left bank as much as possible, while I alone,
with the baggage, navigated the river. We would
keep in touch by occasional shouts.</p>

<p>I got along pretty well, floating down with the
current; but paddling and punting were most difficult,
the raft being almost impossible to steer. On several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-342" id="Pg_2-342"></a>[<a href="./images/2-342.png">342</a>]</span>
occasions I had narrow escapes, just avoiding striking
dangerous rocks&mdash;particularly going down a small
<i>corrideira</i>.</p>

<p>After I had gone about two kilometres I was so
exhausted that I called to Filippe to come on board
again. Eventually&mdash;and I must say that I admired
his courage&mdash;he came on board, and the two of us
proceeded quite well down the stream, one paddling,
the other punting.</p>

<p>We got into a small rapid, where the current was
strong. We were unfortunately thrown violently
against some rocks, the central bottles of our raft
receiving a hard knock. One of them cracked badly.
I was quite perplexed when my eye caught sight of
the radiations in the glass caused by the impact.
Then my ear began to notice the sound of the trickling
of water getting inside the bottle. With positive
concern, as the <i>garaffon</i> was gradually filling, I saw the
raft getting a bad list to port.</p>

<p>The broken <i>garaffon</i> was behind Filippe's back,
and he could not see it. He was constantly asking
me whether something had gone wrong, as he seemed
to feel the water getting higher and higher up his body.</p>

<p>"Is the ship not sinking?" he asked every two
minutes. "I now have water up to my waist."</p>

<p>"No, no, Filippe! Go on. It is all right!"
were the words with which I kept on urging him.</p>

<p>The cracked bottle had got almost entirely filled
with water, and we had such a bad list that the steering
became most difficult. Two or three times again we
were thrown by the current against other rocks, and
another bottle had a similar fate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-343" id="Pg_2-343"></a>[<a href="./images/2-343.png">343</a>]</span>
"We are sinking, are we not?" shouted Filippe.</p>

<p>"No, no!" said I. "Go on!"</p>

<p>As I said those words it suddenly seemed to me
that I heard voices in the distance. Was it Benedicto
calling to us? Filippe and I listened. Surely
there was somebody singing! We fancied we heard
several voices. Had Benedicto met somebody in the
forest?</p>

<p>"Benedicto! Benedicto!" we shouted out to
him. "Have you found men?"</p>

<p>"No!" came the answer from Benedicto.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Filippe, whose eyes had been
scanning the river in front of him, gave a violent jerk
which nearly capsized the raft, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Look! look! There is a canoe!"</p>

<p>"It is a rock," said I, as I screened my eye to
look on the dazzling water, upon which the sun glittered
so that it was almost impossible to perceive anything.
But, sure enough, as I strained my eyes a second time,
I saw something move, and a moment later I heard
voices quite distinctly.</p>

<p>Filippe's joy and mine was intense when we perceived
that not only one boat, but two&mdash;three canoes
were approaching.</p>

<p>We had already travelled some eight kilometres
on our raft when we came close to the boats we had
observed. Their crews stood up in them, rifles in
hand, as we floated down. I shouted that we were
friends. Eventually they came to our help, their
amazement being curious to watch as they got near
us&mdash;they being unable to understand how we could
float down the river merely by sitting on the surface.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-344" id="Pg_2-344"></a>[<a href="./images/2-344.png">344</a>]</span>
By that time the raft was almost altogether submerged.
When they took us on board, and a portion of the raft
came to the surface again, the amusement of those
crews was intense.</p>

<p>I explained who we were. The strangers could
not do enough for us. In a moment they unloaded
the baggage from our craft and put it on board their
boats. They halted near the right bank, and on
hearing of our pitiful plight immediately proceeded
to cook a meal for us.</p>

<p>The people belonged to the rubber-collecting expedition
of a trader named Dom Pedro Nunes, who
went only once every year with a fleet of boats up to
the headwaters of that river in order to bring back
rubber. The expedition&mdash;the only one that ever went
up that river at all&mdash;took eight or ten months on the
journey there and back. It was really an amazing
bit of luck that we should owe our salvation to meeting
that expedition in an almost miraculous way, brought
about by an extraordinary series of fortunate coincidences.</p>

<p>Had we not constructed that raft&mdash;had we not
been on board at that moment&mdash;we should have
missed the expedition and certainly should have died.
Had we been following the bank of the river on foot,
we never could have seen the boats nor heard them,
as the banks were extremely high, and it was never
possible to keep close to the stream when marching
in the forest; we always had to keep some hundred
metres or so from the water in order to avoid the
thick vegetation on the edge of the stream. In fact,
Benedicto, who was walking in the forest along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-345" id="Pg_2-345"></a>[<a href="./images/2-345.png">345</a>]</span>
stream, had gone past the boats and had neither
heard nor seen them. When we shouted out to him
he was already a long distance off, a boat sent out
to him by Dom Pedro Nunes having to travel nearly
800 m. before it could get up to him and bring him
back.</p>

<p>The trader and his men treated us with tender
care. We were practically naked when they met
us, my attire consisting of the leather belt with the
bags of money round my waist, and a small portion
of the sleeveless coat, all torn to pieces. Dom Pedro
Nunes immediately gave me some clothes, while his
men gave garments to Filippe and Benedicto.</p>

<p>Several men rushed about collecting wood, and
in a moment a large flame was blazing. The sight of
proper food brought back our appetites as by magic.
Our ravenous eyes gazed on several big pieces of
<i>anta</i> (<i>Tapirus americanus</i>) meat, through which a
stick had been passed, being broiled over the flame.
We three starving men did not take our eyes off
that meat for a second until the man who was cooking
it removed the stick and said the meat was ready.
We pounced upon it like so many famished tigers.
The meat was so hot that, as we tore away at the
large pieces with our teeth, our lips, noses, and fingers
were absolutely burned by the broiling fat.</p>

<p>Dom Pedro Nunes gently put his hand in front
of me, saying "Do not eat so quickly; it is bad for
you." But I pushed him away with what vigour I
had left. I could have killed anybody who had stood
between that piece of meat and me. I tore at it
lustily with my teeth, until there was nothing left of it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-346" id="Pg_2-346"></a>[<a href="./images/2-346.png">346</a>]</span>
By that time a large bag of <i>farinha</i> had been spread
before us. We grabbed handfuls of it, shoving them
into our mouths as fast as we could.</p>

<p>The sensation of eating&mdash;normal food&mdash;after such
a long fast was a delightful one. But only for a few
moments. Pedro Nunes was just handing me a cup
of coffee when I dropped down unconscious, rejecting
everything with a quantity of blood besides.</p>

<p>When I recovered consciousness, Pedro Nunes
said I had been unconscious for a long time. They
all thought I was dead. I felt almost unbearable
pain in my inside, and a lassitude as if life were about
to be extinguished altogether.</p>

<p>It was evidently the reaction, after eating too
quickly&mdash;and I should like to meet the healthy man
who would not eat quickly under those circumstances&mdash;and
also the relaxation from the inconceivable
strain of so many weeks of mental worry.</p>

<p>I well remember how Pedro Nunes and his men,
when standing around us just as we began eating
that first solid meal, had tears streaming down their
cheeks while watching us in our dreadful plight. Once
more Pedro Nunes&mdash;one of the most kindly men I
have ever met&mdash;sobbed bitterly when he asked me to
take off my clothes and change them for the newer
ones he had given me. I removed from my pocket
the contents: my chronometer, a notebook, and a
number of <i>caju</i> seeds which I had collected, and which,
caustic or not caustic, would have been our only food
until we should have certainly perished.</p>

<p>We heard from Pedro Nunes that it would have
taken us at least six or seven days' steady walking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-347" id="Pg_2-347"></a>[<a href="./images/2-347.png">347</a>]</span>
before we could get to the first house of rubber collectors.
In our exhausted condition we could have
never got there. As for the damaged raft, it could
not have floated more than a few hours longer&mdash;perhaps
not so long.</p>

<p>From the spot where I met Pedro Nunes&mdash;quite
close to the junction of the Canuma River with the
Madeira River&mdash;going down by river it would have
been possible to reach Manaos in two or three days.
Dom Pedro Nunes, however, with his expedition,
could not return, nor sell me a boat, nor lend me men;
so that I thought my best plan was to go back with
him up the River Canuma and then the Secundury
River, especially when I heard from the trader that
the latter river came from the south-east&mdash;which made
me think that perhaps I might find a spot at its most
south-easterly point where the distance would not
be great to travel once more across the forest, back
to my men whom I had left near the Tapajoz.</p>

<p>Pedro Nunes declined to receive payment for
the clothes he had given me and my men, so I presented
him with the Mauser I possessed, which he
greatly appreciated; while I gave the crew which
had rescued us a present of &pound;20 sterling in Brazilian
money.</p>

<p>It was most touching to see how some of the rubber
collectors employed by Pedro Nunes deprived themselves
of tins of jam to present them to us, and also
of other articles which were useful to them in order
to make us a little more comfortable.</p>

<p>I purchased from Pedro Nunes a quantity of provisions&mdash;all
of an inferior kind, but they were the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-348" id="Pg_2-348"></a>[<a href="./images/2-348.png">348</a>]</span>
I could get. Among them were six tins of condensed
milk, all he possessed, for which I paid at the rate of
ten shillings each&mdash;the regular price in that neighbourhood.
Those tins of milk were a great joy to Benedicto,
Filippe and myself.</p>

<p>Although the pain was violent when we ate anything,
the craving for food was now quite insatiable,
and we could not resist the temptation of eating
whatever came under our hands.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of that same day we started
up the river with Pedro Nunes and his fleet of boats.
In the evening, when we camped, the kindness of the
trader and his men towards us was most pathetic.
Drenching rain fell during the night.</p>

<p>On September 22nd we made an early start.
Pedro Nunes went away in a small boat, as he wanted
to go and explore a small tributary of the Secundury.
The expedition travelled up the main stream at a
great pace, with the many men who were rowing and
punting.</p>

<p>Filippe, Benedicto and I suffered horrible internal
pains that day owing to our careless eating the previous
afternoon.</p>

<p class="fsc">Indian Idols of the Putumayo District.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was greatly worried by the man who had been
left in charge of the expedition&mdash;a man of extreme
kindness, but an incessant talker. He spoke so loudly,
repeating the same things over and over again, that
in my weak state, and accustomed as we were to the
deathly silence of the forest, it tired me inexpressibly.
His conversation consisted entirely of accusing everybody
he knew of being robbers and assassins, and in
long descriptions, with numberless figures, to show<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-349" id="Pg_2-349"></a>[<a href="./images/2-349.png">349</a>]</span>
how he had been robbed of small sums of money by
various people he had met in his lifetime.</p>

<p>I presented him with &pound;10 sterling, hoping that he
would keep quiet, as that seemed to be the entire sum
of which he had been robbed by his relatives and
friends; also because on seeing our wretched condition,
he had presented me with an enormous pair
of shoes, about six sizes too large for me. When I
walked in them, especially up and down the steep
banks, I lost now one shoe, now the other, so big were
they. But I was grateful to him, as he would not
take payment for them, and they saved my feet to a
certain extent&mdash;when I could keep them on&mdash;from the
thorns, which were numerous in that region.</p>

<p>The prolonged immersion in the water the day
before, while we were navigating the raft, and the
subsequent rest, had caused my feet to swell enormously,
my ankles being about three times their
normal size, so swollen were they. I experienced an
unbearable pain in my heart, with continuous heart-burning
and sudden throbbings, succeeded by spells
of exhaustion. Giddiness in my head was constant,
and I was so weak that it was all I could do to move.
Even the exertion of shifting from one side to the
other of the boat on which I was travelling was enough
to make me almost collapse with fatigue.</p>

<p>We travelled great distances, going on all day
and the greater part of the night, with relays of men,
on September 22nd and 23rd.</p>

<p>The Secundury was a stream with an average
width of 60 m. and in many places quite deep. It
had a great many little springs and streamlets flowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-350" id="Pg_2-350"></a>[<a href="./images/2-350.png">350</a>]</span>
into it between steep cuts in its high embankments,
which were of alluvial formation mingled with decayed
vegetation. The banks almost all along were from
40 to 50 ft. high. We came across a large tributary
on the right side of the river. It was evidently the
stream to which we had first come on our disastrous
march across the forest, and which I had mistaken
for the Secundury. Beyond this river we came across
some small rapids, of no importance and quite easy
to negotiate by the large boats, although in one or
two cases tow-ropes had to be used by the men who
had landed in order to pull the boats through.</p>

<p>On September 23rd we passed some easy <i>corrideiras</i>.
I had slept almost that entire day on the roof of the
boat, in the sun. It did me good. Late in the
evening, at about seven o'clock, we arrived at a trader's
hut, called S&atilde;o Jos&eacute;, which was in the charge of a
squinting mulatto&mdash;a most peculiar fellow.</p>

<p>On September 24th I stayed at the trader's house,
spending the whole day drying thoroughly in the
sun my notebooks and negatives and repacking them,
so that I could leave them at that spot until I could
fetch them again. My idea was to walk from that
place across the forest once more back to our original
point of departure near the Tapajoz River, where I
had left the remainder of my party and the main part
of my baggage.</p>

<p>A runaway <i>seringueiro</i> was induced to accompany
me on that errand, while another man remained with
faithful Filippe in charge of my valuable possessions.
I left with them supplies for three months, which
I had purchased from Pedro Nunes' expedition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-351" id="Pg_2-351"></a>[<a href="./images/2-351.png">351</a>]</span>
On September 25th I went a short distance farther
up the river to its most south-easterly point. From
there, with two men and provisions for thirty days,
bidding goodbye to the men who had saved our lives,
we started, still in a weak and exhausted condition, on
our march back to the men we had left behind.</p>

<p>We only carried food supplies with us. I had left
everything else on the Secundury River. Marching
was indeed painful, as I had absolutely no strength,
and was in a high fever. I stumbled along in excruciating
pain, now losing one shoe, now the other,
when they caught in some liana. There were a great
many fallen trees in that part of the forest, which gave
us no end of trouble, when, exhausted as Benedicto
and I were, we had to climb over them or else squeeze
under.</p>

<p>So great was my anxiety, however, to get back
that, notwithstanding the pain, I marched along,
following the new man, who was in good condition.
We went 20 kil. that day.</p>

<p>The forest near the Secundury River was at first
overgrown with dense vegetation, which gave us a
good deal of work and extra exertion; but after that,
when we got some distance from the water, the forest
was fairly clean, except of course for the fallen trees.
We found troublesome ravines of great height where
streamlets had cut their way through.</p>

<p>In going down one of those difficult ravines I had
an accident which might have been fatal. The ravine,
the sides of which were almost vertical, was very
narrow&mdash;only about 10 m. across. We let ourselves
down, holding on to liane. When we reached the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-352" id="Pg_2-352"></a>[<a href="./images/2-352.png">352</a>]</span>
bottom we found a tiny brook winding its way between
great round boulders, and leaving a space about 2 ft.
wide for the water. I proceeded up on the other side,
and I had got up to a height of some 30 ft. In order
to go up this steep incline I had placed one foot against
a small tree while I was pulling myself up by a liana.
Unluckily, the liana suddenly gave way. The weight
of the load which I had on my shoulders made
me lose my balance, so that my body described an
entire semicircle. I dropped down head first from
that height on the rocks below.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-352.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-352_th.jpg" alt="Trading Boats landing Balls of Rubber, River Tapajoz." title="Trading Boats landing Balls of Rubber, River Tapajoz." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Trading Boats landing Balls of Rubber, River Tapajoz.</p>
<hr />
<p>Providence once more looked after me on that
occasion. On the flight down I already imagined
myself dead; but no&mdash;my head entered the cavity
between the two rocks against which my shoulders
and the load became jammed, while my legs were
struggling up in mid-air. I was forced so hard against
the two side rocks that I could not possibly extricate
myself. It was only when Benedicto and the new
man came to my help and pulled me out that we were
able to resume our journey&mdash;I much shaken and
somewhat aching, but otherwise none the worse for
that unpleasant fall.</p>

<p>On September 26th my two men were already
complaining of their loads. They said they could
not go on any more&mdash;the man in good health and full
of strength rebelling more than poor Benedicto, who
was in a weak condition. So that we might march
quickly I decided to abandon one bag of flour and
eight tins of salt butter. With the lighter loads we
marched comparatively well, and went 22 kil. that
day with no particular experience worth noticing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-353" id="Pg_2-353"></a>[<a href="./images/2-353.png">353</a>]</span>
On September 27th we started once more quite
early, after a hearty breakfast&mdash;notwithstanding the
pain which I always had whenever I ate, especially a
stabbing pain in my heart which was almost unbearable
at times. We crossed several streamlets, one
fairly large, all of which flowed into the Secundury.
Rain, which came down in torrents, greatly interfered
with our march that day, the new man I had
employed worrying me all the time, saying that he
did not like to march in wet clothes. Benedicto and
I could not help laughing at him, as we had not been
dry one moment since the beginning of July, and we
were now at the end of September. Wet or not
wet, I made the man come along. Finding the forest
comparatively clean, we covered another 20 kil. that
day. We had a most miserable night, rain coming
down in sheets upon us. I was suffering from high
fever, chiefly from exhaustion and the effects of over-eating,
most injurious to my internal arrangements,
which had got dried up during the long sixteen days'
fast. I shivered with cold the entire night.</p>

<p>When we got up the next morning, dripping all
over, with water still pouring down in bucketfuls
upon us from above, Benedicto said that if it went
on much longer like that he should surely turn into a
fish. He looked comical, with water streaming down
from his hair, his ears, nose and coat.</p>

<p>The trousers which our friend Pedro Nunes had
given me were made of cheap calico, printed in little
checks. They were of the kind that was usually sold
to the <i>seringueiros</i>, and looked pretty when they were
new. But they were a little too small, and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-354" id="Pg_2-354"></a>[<a href="./images/2-354.png">354</a>]</span>
evidently not been shrunk before they were made.
With the great moisture that night they shrank so
badly all of a sudden that they split in four or five
different places. I had no way of mending them.</p>

<p>As we went on&mdash;on September 28th&mdash;we encountered
a great deal of entangled vegetation, many liane
and thorns, which completely finished up my lower
garments. My coat also, which was of similar material,
was beginning to give signs of wear and tear, the
sewing of the sleeves and at the back having burst
everywhere.</p>

<p>We were going over almost level ground that day,
across forest sparsely wooded and with much undergrowth
of palms and ferns. We had drenching rain
the entire day. My trousers were in shreds, dangling
and catching in everything. When we had gone
some eight or ten kilometres they were such a
trouble to me that I discarded them altogether.
The coat, too, was getting to be more of a nuisance
than a protection. Owing to the incessant rain we
were only able to march 14 kil. that day.</p>

<p>On September 29th we again started off, marching
due east. We had slightly better weather, and were
fortunate enough to shoot two monkeys, a <i>coati</i>, and
a <i>jac&uacute;</i>, the new man possessing a rifle of his own, for
which I had bought 200 cartridges from our friend
Pedro Nunes. We had, therefore, that day, a good
meal of meat; but what terrible pain we felt when we
devoured the tough pieces of those animals, which
we had broiled over a big flame! Notwithstanding
the pain, however, we had an irresistible and insatiable
craving for food.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-355" id="Pg_2-355"></a>[<a href="./images/2-355.png">355</a>]</span>
That day we made a good march of 24 kil.</p>

<p>On September 30th the marching was comparatively
easy, through fairly clean forest, so that we had to
use our knife very little in order to open our way.
We crossed a small <i>campo</i> with a good deal of rock
upon it, and as our strength was gradually coming
back we struggled along, covering a distance of 34 kil.
between seven o'clock in the morning and seven in
the evening. I was anxious to push on as fast as
we possibly could, notwithstanding the grumblings
of my men, for now that we had abandoned half of
our supplies of food I did not want to have, if I
could help it, another experience of starvation.</p>

<p>On October 1st we had more trouble cutting our
way through, as we again found great ferns and palms,
especially near streamlets of water, and quantities
of fallen trees, which made us continually deviate
from our direction. The forest was indeed dirty and
much entangled in that section, and thus made our
march painful, liane catching my feet and head all
the time, tearing my ears and nose&mdash;especially when
the man who walked in front of me let them
go suddenly and they swung right in my face.
Thorns dug big grooves into my legs, arms and hands.
To make matters worse, the high fever seemed to
exhaust me terribly. Worse luck, a huge boil, as
big as an egg, developed under my left knee, while
another of equal size appeared on my right ankle,
already much swollen and aching. The huge shoes
given me by the trader&mdash;of the cheapest manufacture&mdash;had
already fallen to pieces. I had turned the soles
of them into sandals, held up by numerous bits of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-356" id="Pg_2-356"></a>[<a href="./images/2-356.png">356</a>]</span>
string, which cut my toes and ankles very badly every
time I knocked my feet against a tree or stone. My
feet were full of thorns, so numerous that I had not
the energy to remove them. The left leg was absolutely
stiff with the big boil, and I could not bend it.</p>

<p>Limping along, stumbling all the time in intense
pain&mdash;the boils being prevented from coming to
maturity owing to the constant cold moisture&mdash;I
really had as painful a time as one could imagine on
those long marches back.</p>

<p>On October 2nd we had to cut our way through
all the time, still marching due east. We encountered
two high hill ranges, which gave us a lot to do as in
our weak condition we proceeded to climb them.
We had eaten more food than we should have done,
and the result was that we now had none left, except
a tin of <i>guyabada</i> (sweet cheese). I had become almost
as improvident as the Brazilians when it came to food,
as I could not resist the temptation, and instead of
the usual three meals a day we were munching food
all the time.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-356.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-356_th.jpg" alt="Itaituba." title="Itaituba." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Itaituba.</p>
<hr />
<p>The strong fever was wearing me out. The dissatisfaction
of my men because we had no more food&mdash;it
was their own fault, for they had insisted on
leaving most of it behind&mdash;and their constant grumbling
were tiring me to death. We killed a small bird in
the evening. By the time we had broiled it over a
flame it satisfied but little our ravenous appetites.</p>

<p>On October 3rd we reached quantities of boulders
and rocks, which showed me that we were once
more approaching the extensive rocky table-land I
had seen on our outward journey. As we climbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-357" id="Pg_2-357"></a>[<a href="./images/2-357.png">357</a>]</span>
up higher and higher we came to an elevated
streamlet of limpid water running in a channel carved
out of the solid rock. It took us over two hours'
steady marching, going perhaps some 2&frac12; miles an
hour, to cross the summit of that high rocky tableland.
Then we descended through <i>chapada</i> and found
ourselves among a lot of ravines, on the slope of one
of which we halted for the night. There we killed
two large monkeys, which we proceeded to broil and
eat. I never liked the idea of eating monkeys, as I
could not get over the feeling that I was eating a
child, they looked so human. The hands and arms
particularly, after they had been roasted over the
fire, looked too human for words.</p>

<p>On October 4th we climbed a steep and rocky hill,
crossing on its summit another section of the rocky
plateau, a regular dome of grey volcanic rock. Then,
descending from this second tableland on its eastern
side, we had to struggle and stumble through most
rugged country, where I found an extinct circular
crater some 50 ft. in diameter and 50 ft. deep, with a
vent at an angle in its bottom going apparently to a
great depth. Near that spot was also a strange giant
natural gateway of rock.</p>

<p>The descent was steep, and most trying for us
among the great boulders over which we had to climb
on our hands and feet. When we got to the bottom
of this elevated country, the forest we found had
quite a different aspect, which suggested to me the
approach of the big river. We found there plenty of
wild fruit, particularly some small black berries&mdash;called
in Brazilian <i>patta&otilde;a</i>&mdash;quite good to eat; also some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-358" id="Pg_2-358"></a>[<a href="./images/2-358.png">358</a>]</span>
most palatable tiny red cherries. We wasted a good
deal of time picking up the fruit instead of marching,
my men complaining all day long of an empty
stomach. They would not take my advice to
march quickly, so that we might then get plenty of
food on the river. During the last few days, as I
knew we must have been near the camp where I had
left my men in charge of my baggage, we had constantly
been firing sets of three shots&mdash;the agreed
signal&mdash;in order to locate the exact spot where they
were. But we had received no answer. Failing that,
it was impossible to locate them exactly in the virgin
forest, unless we had plenty of time and strength at
our disposal.</p>

<p>I made sure, by the appearance of the forest, that
we were now not far off from the stream. In fact, on
October 5th, when we had marched some distance,
much to my delight as I walked ahead of my men,
who were busy picking up berries as they struggled
along, I recognized a little streamlet on which I had
made my camp the first night I had started out on
our disastrous journey across the forest.</p>

<p>My men, when I mentioned the fact, were sceptical
and said it could not possibly be, as we must still be
a long distance from the Tapajoz. But we had only
gone a few hundred metres farther when I came upon
my old camp. There an empty sardine-tin of a special
mark which I carried was lying on the ground.</p>

<p>I think that that spoke pretty well for the accuracy
with which I could march across the forest by compass.
I knew that at that spot we were only 6 kil. from the
river. We indulged there in the last tin of the sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-359" id="Pg_2-359"></a>[<a href="./images/2-359.png">359</a>]</span>
<i>guyabada</i>, which I had kept for an emergency. After
that we metaphorically flew through the forest, so
fast did we march&mdash;if stumbling along constantly
and even occasionally falling can be called flying.
Even at that last moment, when our hearts were
rejoiced, our progress was impeded by a thunderstorm,
which broke out with such force that we had
to halt for nearly two hours until it slightly abated.
The wind howled among the trees, which shook and
waved to and fro, some crashing down, so that, with
the thunder and lightning and the rush of the water,
it seemed a regular pandemonium.</p>

<p>"The devil is angry with us," said Benedicto the
philosopher. "He does not want us to get back."</p>

<p>My impatience to get quickly to the river was so
great that I could not wait for the storm to be over.
In the drenching rain we continued our tramp. My
sandals had given way altogether in the quick march
that day, and I was once more walking with bare
feet. Marching so quickly, one did not always have
time to detect thorns. That day my feet were indeed
in a pitiable condition.</p>

<p>The last trial of all was yet to be added, when we
had come to within 300 m. of the river. The <i>seringueiro</i>,
from whose hut we had started on our way out, had
evidently since our departure set the forest on fire
in order to make a <i>ro&ccedil;a</i> so as to cultivate the land.
Hundreds of carbonized trees had fallen down in all
directions; others had been cut down. So that for
those last two or three hundred metres we had to get
over or under those burned trees and struggle through
their blackened boughs, the stumps of which drove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-360" id="Pg_2-360"></a>[<a href="./images/2-360.png">360</a>]</span>
holes into and scratched big patches of skin from my
legs, arms and face. Where the skin was not taken off
altogether it was smeared all over with the black from
the burnt trees. We did not look unlike nigger minstrels,
with the exception that we were also bleeding all over.</p>

<hr />
<p>What had remained of my poor coat had been torn
to shreds, so that all I possessed now in the way of
clothing was a shirt. As the <i>seringueiro</i> had a wife
I could not well appear in that condition before her
when we had reached the hut. Hiding behind a tree,
we shouted for the <i>seringueiro</i> to come to our assistance.
Benedicto, who was not so bashful, and whose costume
was not much better than mine, proceeded to the house.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, as I peeped from behind my
tree, I had a moment of great joy. I had been
wondering during the last few days whether my men
had died in the forest, or what could have become of
them, as we had not received an answer to our signals.
There I saw Alcides rush out of the house and run
toward me. His cheeks streamed with tears. "Senhor!
Senhor!" he sobbed, embracing me.</p>

<p>Antonio, who followed behind, came up and shook
hands, merely saying "Good morning!"</p>

<p>"Where is white Filippe? Where is the man
X?" I hastily inquired, in order to make sure that
they were still alive.</p>

<p>"They are fishing on the river." Alcides called
out to them: "Come quickly! 'El Senhor' has returned!"</p>

<p>White Filippe immediately ran up, but the man X
shouted back that he was busy fishing; he would
come up later.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-361" id="Pg_2-361"></a>[<a href="./images/2-361.png">361</a>]</span>
Alcides was much upset on seeing my plight. He
ran immediately into the hut and got me some clothes
from the <i>seringueiro</i>, which I put on before entering
the house. The <i>seringueiro</i> was kindness itself to me,
most thoughtful and hospitable. He prepared some
food for us at once. That was a day of joy and
sadness combined. I found that all my men were
safe, but that they had abandoned all my baggage
and all my collections in the forest. They believed
that I had been assassinated by Indians or that I
had died of starvation.</p>

<p>Alcides cried like a child for some time. He and
the others were ill with fever. Those men I had left
in charge of my baggage at the camp in the forest
had remained at that camp for seven days after my
departure. Believing that I was never coming back,
three of them had abandoned everything there, and
even their companion Antonio, who was in a dying
condition and was unable to walk. They had proceeded
quickly to the Tapajoz, where they had found
plenty to eat. Two or three days later Antonio had
become better; he had shot some monkeys and birds,
and had been able to keep alive. Had it not been
for the kind-hearted <i>seringueiro</i>, Albuquerque, who had
started out to rescue Antonio, the poor devil would
have certainly died there, abandoned by everybody.</p>

<p>I heard stories that day which pained me a great
deal. When my men believed that I was lost in the
forest the man X had proposed to his companions
to follow the <i>picada</i> I had cut in order to find my
body and rob me of all the money which he knew I
carried.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-362" id="Pg_2-362"></a>[<a href="./images/2-362.png">362</a>]</span>
"If he is alive," he had said to his companions,
"we will cut his throat once for all, and we will divide
the money amongst ourselves."</p>

<p>It was with some difficulty that Alcides had prevented
him from smashing all my baggage open, as
he wished to divide the contents with his companions.
Alcides was an honest man. He had stood up against
that rascal. After a severe fight it had been decided
that the baggage should be left intact in the forest
until such authorities as could be sent up from the
Fiscal Agency could visit the spot and take charge of
my things.</p>

<p>It was then that I understood why the man X
was now ashamed to face me, and did not come to
greet me after I had nearly sacrificed my life to save
him and his companions.</p>

<p>Albuquerque, the <i>seringueiro</i>, had also been considerate
enough to lift my baggage upon stones and
then cover it up with palm leaves, so that it should be
preserved as much as possible from moisture and ants.
During the month they had been back on the Tapajoz
the man X had once taken a journey alone to the
spot where the baggage and Antonio had been left,
hoping to find his companion dead and so rob him of
the money which he knew he had in his possession&mdash;the
pay he had received from me.</p>

<p>Here is another charming incident. Nearly dead
with fatigue, I lay helpless in a hammock which
the <i>seringueiro</i> had hung for me. He and his wife
had gone out to look after their new plantation,
and only my men remained loafing about.</p>

<p>The river was some 60 m. from the hut, and one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-363" id="Pg_2-363"></a>[<a href="./images/2-363.png">363</a>]</span>
had to go down a steep bank to reach the water. My
throat was parched from the high fever, so I called
Antonio, who was near me, to give me a glass of water.
Antonio never budged, but called to white Filippe,
some way off, to bring the water. Filippe called to
the man X, repeating my order to him. The man X
continued fishing without taking the slightest notice.</p>

<p>So that, exhausted as I was, I had to struggle
down to the river myself, as those men, for whom
I had almost died, reciprocated my sacrifice in so
graceful a fashion.</p>

<p>I think that I might as well mention here a curious
case of telepathy which occurred during those terrible
days of starvation.</p>

<p>Naturally, when one has before one the prospect
of leaving this world at any moment, and one is
working under a severe mental strain, one generally
thinks deeply of one's beloved parents and relatives.
Thus my father, mother and sister were before me
all the time in my imagination. Sometimes when I
was half-dazed I could see them so vividly that I
could almost believe they were so close that I could
touch them. I never thought that I should see them
again, in reality, although I never actually lost hope
of doing so; but I was thinking incessantly of them,
and of the anxiety I was causing them, as I had had
no possible way of communicating with them for months
and months.</p>

<p>There would be nothing extraordinary in that,
but the amazing part of it all was that my parents
and my sister&mdash;who had no idea whatever that I
was exploring, as I always take the greatest care not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-364" id="Pg_2-364"></a>[<a href="./images/2-364.png">364</a>]</span>
to let them know&mdash;actually during that time of
starvation saw me in their imagination lying unconscious
in the forest, dying of hunger, swarming all
over with ants and surrounded by crocodiles.</p>

<p>When I reached Rio de Janeiro in April of the following
year I found there a number of letters which had
been written to me by my parents and my sister during
the month of September, in which they told me of
those constant visions repeating themselves daily,
especially between the dates of September 8th and
September 24th. Those letters were written long
before anybody knew that I had ever suffered from
starvation in the forest. It is quite remarkable
that, except the crocodiles&mdash;which, of course, were
not to be found in the forest&mdash;they reproduced the
conditions with wonderful faithfulness, the telepathic
connection having in that case been established vividly
at a distance of several thousand miles.</p>

Itaituba to the Amazon&mdash;Benedicto and the
Man X are discharged</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 6th and 7th I spent inside a hammock. I
was in such a high fever and so absolutely exhausted
that I believed I should never be able to pull through.
Albuquerque and his wife were kindness itself to me,
and looked after me most tenderly. While I had
been away a trading boat had passed. That boat
would be on its way down the river again in a
few days. I thought I would take advantage of this
to go down as far as the mouth of the Tapajoz on
the Amazon in her.</p>

<p>On the evening of October 7th, Benedicto, who
was a great glutton, prepared a huge bowl of the
<i>mam&atilde;o</i> fruit stewed and sweetened with quantities
of sugar. I had obtained from Albuquerque some
tins of shrimps, lobster and salmon, butter and jam&mdash;all
condemned stuff from some ship&mdash;and I gave all
my men a feast. Benedicto brought me some of the
sweet he had prepared, and it looked so tempting
that, ill as I was, I ate a quantity of it. After dinner
I persuaded my men to go back to the forest to recover
the baggage they had abandoned there. Tempted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-366" id="Pg_2-366"></a>[<a href="./images/2-366.png">366</a>]</span>
by a present of money I offered them if they would
bring it back safely, they all agreed to go.</p>

<p>On October 8th, however, when the men were to
start, the man X had a severe colic. He rolled himself
on the ground in great pain, and refused to go.</p>

<p>The strong fever had finished me to such an extent
that I did not think I should last many hours longer.
Albuquerque and his wife stood by my hammock
watching me, Albuquerque shaking his head compassionately,
asking me if I wanted to write a last
word to my family, which he would send down by
the trading boat when she arrived. I well remember
hearing his voice faintly, as I was in a half-dazed condition.
I had not the strength to answer. As he
walked out of the room he said to his wife: "Poor
fellow! he will not be alive in another hour!"</p>

<p>Albuquerque was a most thoughtful Brazilian,
intelligent and well-educated, quite superior for the
position he occupied there.</p>

<p>I was still alive on October 9th, much to the
surprise of everybody, and feeling much better. There
was a great slaughter of chickens, Albuquerque saying
that I needed chicken broth badly; in fact, that day
I drank cup after cup, and it seemed to give me a
little strength. Although those chickens had a local
value of about &pound;1 sterling each, Albuquerque would
not hear of my paying for them. I knew what
inconvenience it would be for him to slaughter them
in that fashion, as he could not replace them perhaps
for several months.</p>

<p>Good news came that day, when Albuquerque's
wife entered the room saying that some trading boats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-367" id="Pg_2-367"></a>[<a href="./images/2-367.png">367</a>]</span>
were coming up the river&mdash;she could see them a long
way off, just getting over the Capueras Falls. I
decided to go up in one of those boats as far as the
Fiscal Agency at S. Manoel, where I could obtain fresh
clothes and provisions. Remaining still inside a house
I felt was killing me.</p>

<p>The boats did not arrive that evening. The next
day, October 10th, rain came down in sheets, so that
we could not see more than a few metres in front of
us, and the wind was howling with fury.</p>

<p>On October 11th, when the boats approached, Albuquerque
took me up in a small canoe to them on the
other side of the wide stream. It was the trading fleet
of Don Eulogio Mori, a Peruvian trader, who at once
offered all possible assistance and undertook to convey
me up stream with pleasure.</p>

<p>Mr. Mori, a most enterprising man, who was in
charge of the expedition, was a frank, open and jolly
gentleman, most charmingly thoughtful and civil. He
and his brother had the second largest rubber-trading
business on the upper Tapajoz River.</p>

<p>He was amazed when I got on board and told him
who I was, as the news had already spread down the
river that I had been murdered by my own men in
the forest. In fact, during my absence, when Alcides
had travelled up to the Fiscal Agency to inform them
of what was happening, he had been detained there
for some days and accused with his companions of
having murdered me.</p>

<p>As we went up the stream once more we passed
Mount S. Benedicto, with its foliated rock in grey and
red strata. Volleys were fired in honour of the saint;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-368" id="Pg_2-368"></a>[<a href="./images/2-368.png">368</a>]</span>
more candles were deposited on the platform of
rock.</p>

<p>When we halted for lunch, one of the crew died
of yellow fever. After lunch a grave was dug and
the corpse duly deposited in it.</p>

<p>We had not gone far when the trading boats of
Colonel Brazil, under the care of Mr. Jo&atilde;o Pinto,
came in sight on their way down the river. Therefore
I abandoned the idea of going up to S. Manoel, as,
had I not taken the opportunity of going down with
Mr. Pinto, I might have had to wait up the river some
two or three months before I had another opportunity.</p>

<p>Again I met with the greatest kindness on the part
of Mr. Pinto when I transhipped from the Peruvian
boats.</p>

<p>In a few hours, travelling rapidly down stream, I
was once more at Albuquerque's hut, where Mr. Pinto
most kindly offered to halt one day in order that I
might wait for the men who had gone in search of my
baggage in the forest.</p>

<hr />
<p>Next day, October 16th, as I was in great suspense
lest the men should not arrive in time&mdash;Mr. Pinto
being pressed to get quickly down the river with some
thousands of kilos of rubber he had purchased&mdash;my
men eventually arrived with part of the baggage. They
had abandoned the rest in the forest, including my
valuable botanical collection, which had taken me so
many months of careful labour. Alcides said that
the termites had played havoc with all my things.
The wooden boxes had been almost entirely destroyed,
as well as most of the contents. I was glad, nevertheless,
to get back what I did, the man Benedicto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-369" id="Pg_2-369"></a>[<a href="./images/2-369.png">369</a>]</span>
on that occasion behaving splendidly&mdash;even going
back to the spot where the tragic scene had taken
place with the Indian Miguel on our outward journey
and recovering some of my instruments which I had
abandoned there.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of October 16th I bade goodbye
to Albuquerque, and gave him a present of &pound;20
sterling, as he would not accept payment for the
hospitality he had offered me.</p>

<p>With a powerful crew of men we sped down the
river quickly. In a couple of hours we had already
arrived at the rapids of the Capueras. After passing
the island of Pombas before entering the rapids, we
encountered the first rapid of Sirgar Torta; then the
second rapid of Baunilla&mdash;named after the vanilla
plant. The third rapid of the Capueras group was
called Chafaris; then the fourth was the Campinho.</p>

<p>We went along the banks of the beautiful island
of Antas, after which we halted at the house of Jos&eacute;
Maracati, a Mundurucu chieftain, with thirty Indians
under him. A delegate of the Para Province in charge
of the Indians&mdash;a man of strong Malay characteristics
and evidently of Indian parentage&mdash;received us, and
gave me much information about the local rubber
industry. He told me that the best rubber found in
that region was the kind locally called <i>seringa preta</i>,
a black rubber which was coagulated with the smoke
of the <i>coco de palmeira</i>. He calculated that 150 rubber
trees gave about 14 kilos of rubber a day. The
<i>seringa preta</i> exuded latex all the year round, even
during the rainy season.</p>

<p>There was in that region also another kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-370" id="Pg_2-370"></a>[<a href="./images/2-370.png">370</a>]</span>
rubber tree&mdash;the <i>itauba</i>&mdash;but it was of inferior quality,
as the latex was too liquid, like reddish milk, quite
weak, and with little elasticity.</p>

<p>A few trees of the <i>castanha do Para</i> were also found
in that region, producing the well-known nut which
has rendered Brazil famous in England.</p>

<p><i>Solveira</i> trees were also plentiful all over that
district, and gave latex which was good to drink;
while another tree, called the <i>amap&aacute;</i>, exuded latex
somewhat thinner than that of the <i>solveira</i>, which
was supposed to be beneficial in cases of consumption
or tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Very interesting were the different liane in the
forest there, particularly the <i>cepa de agua</i>, which
when cut gave most delicious fresh water to drink.
The <i>titica</i> was a smaller liana, which was most troublesome
when you went through the forest, as it generally
caught you and twisted round your feet as it lay for
long distances along the ground.</p>

<p>Another wild fruit which was abundant there was
the <i>pajur&aacute;</i>, dark in colour, soft-skinned, most palatable
and quite nourishing, but which gave an insatiable
thirst after you had eaten it.</p>

<p>We resumed our journey among a lot of islands,
traversing the Cabeceira de Piquarana. The main
rapid was formidable enough, although nothing in
comparison with the rapids we had gone over on the
Arinos-Juruena river. There was a barrier of rock
extending from W.S.W. to E.N.E. across the river,
which was there 1,500 metres broad and of great
beauty, with hillocks on either side and some small
islets in mid-stream.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-371" id="Pg_2-371"></a>[<a href="./images/2-371.png">371</a>]</span>
Soon afterwards we came to another barrier of rock,
extending from north to south. It was called the
Bigua. There was an island of the same name, the
name being taken from an aquatic bird which is
plentiful there.</p>

<p>The traders talked a great deal of the dangers of
those rapids, and they were certainly dangerous because
of the innumerable submerged rocks; but after the
fierceness of those we had encountered before they
seemed child's play to us.</p>

<p>The river there followed a direction of b.m. 60&deg;.</p>

<p>We spent the night of October 16th-17th at the
<i>seringueiro's</i> farm of Boa Vista, most beautifully
situated where the river described a big curve. In
its crudeness the hospitality of those exiles was quite
charming. They hardly ever spoke; they just laid
things before you&mdash;all they possessed&mdash;and were overcome
with surprise when you thanked them for it or
when you offered payment.</p>

<p>There was a project of constructing a cart-road
for some 20 kil. along the bank, in order to avoid the
rapids which occurred there in the river. Although
those rapids were not impressive to look at, they were
strewn with submerged rocks just under the surface,
which were very dangerous for the large trading boats.
If that road were constructed a great deal of time
would be saved, especially in ascending the river,
when sometimes the trading boats took as long as a
week or ten days to get over that particular rapid.</p>

<p>The first rapid we saw after we left Boa Vista was
the Vira Sebo rapid, slightly worse than the following
ones. I was getting a little better, living on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-372" id="Pg_2-372"></a>[<a href="./images/2-372.png">372</a>]</span>
roof of the trading boat, thoughtfully looked after
by Mr. Jo&atilde;o Pinto and the other employ&eacute;s of Col.
Brazil. I was able to drink quantities of condensed
milk, and my strength seemed to be slowly coming back.</p>

<hr />
<p>The river had many islets as we proceeded on our
journey, with wooded hillocks some 100 to 150 ft.
high in long successive undulations along the river
banks. The coast-line was generally of rocky volcanic
formation, with accumulations of boulders in many
places right across the stream.</p>

<p>After passing the rapids we were travelling through
a region of extensive and beautiful sand-beaches,
with hardly any rock showing through anywhere.
The country on each side was almost altogether flat,
merely an occasional hill being visible here and there.</p>

<p>On October 19th we came in for a howling storm
of wind and rain, waves being produced in the river
as high as those that occur in the sea. We tossed
about considerably and shipped a lot of water. More
immense sand-beaches were passed, and then we
came to a region of domed rocks showing along the
river bank. At all the <i>barac&atilde;os</i>, or trading sheds
where the <i>seringueiros</i> bought their supplies, the same
rubbish was for sale: condemned, quite uneatable ship
biscuits sold at 5<i>s.</i> a kilo; Epsom salts at the rate of
&pound;2 sterling a kilo; putrid tinned meat at the rate
of 10<i>s.</i> a tin; 1-lb. tins of the commonest French
salt butter fetched the price of 10<i>s.</i> each. The conversation
at all those halting-places where the trading
boats stopped was dull beyond words, the local scandal&mdash;there
was plenty of it always&mdash;having little interest
for me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-373" id="Pg_2-373"></a>[<a href="./images/2-373.png">373</a>]</span>
At one place we were met by a charming girl
dressed up in all her finery, singing harmonious songs
to the accompaniment of her guitar. So great was
her desire to be heard that she kept on the music
incessantly during the whole time we stopped&mdash;some
three hours&mdash;although nobody paid the slightest
attention to it after the first song or two.</p>

<p>Farther down the river, there 800 m. wide, hills
and undulations were to be seen on each side. At
sunset that day we arrived at S. Isabel or Castanho,
where I had the pleasure of meeting the greatest man
upon that river&mdash;Col. R. E. Brazil, a man of immense
strength of will and enterprise. He went under the
name, which he well deserved, of the "King of the
Tapajoz"; for it was he who indeed held the key of
that river, nearly the entire commerce on that great
waterway being, directly or indirectly, in his hands.</p>

<p>October 20th was spent at S. Isabel, where a great
fleet of boats was waiting to be loaded with thousands
upon thousands of kilos of magnificent rubber.</p>

<p>Both Col. Brazil and his employ&eacute;s treated me with
great deference, and made preparations to get a boat
ready at once for me to continue my journey down
the stream. In fact, Col. Brazil, who would not hear
of my paying for being conveyed down stream, insisted
upon my being his guest, and declared that he himself
would take me to a point where I might be able to
get a steamer.</p>

<p>When all the boats were ready, at 4 p.m. on
October 20th, we proceeded on our journey down the
Tapajoz by a small channel on the right side of the
river, in order to visit some of the trading sheds be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-374" id="Pg_2-374"></a>[<a href="./images/2-374.png">374</a>]</span>longing
to Col. Brazil, especially those at the mouth
of the Crepore River, which was 100 m. wide where
it entered the Tapajoz on the right side. The scenery
was beautiful, the hills getting higher as we proceeded
north, some of the islands we passed also being of
great height and forming picturesque scenes, especially
against the gorgeous tints of the sky at sunset.</p>

<p>I was interested in observing the wonderful regularity
of the sky-line along the forest. It looked as
if the trees had been trimmed artificially in a perfectly
straight line. The fleet which Col. Brazil was taking
down the river consisted of eight large boats. I
was much impressed by the force of mind of Col.
Brazil, together with his great charm and thoughtfulness
when not at work. His men were in mortal fear
of him, and trembled all over when he spoke to them.</p>

<p>No serious obstacle to navigation was encountered
as we proceeded on our journey, although rocks were
plentiful, great red domes and boulders galore showing
through the water and along the coast-line. Whitish
vertical cliffs were noticeable along the higher hills.
The most impressive things I saw in that part of the
river were the extensive beaches of beautiful reddish
sand extending for hundreds and hundreds of metres
at a time. Those beaches were often 10 to 20 ft. high.</p>

<p>The river was most interesting, especially near the
beach of Curass&aacute;, with Crato in the distance; then the
great meadow of "Mission Nova" extending in a
north-westerly direction on the left bank, along the
tributary of the same name. In the same direction
extended also the rocky barrier at the beginning of
the Mangabel rapid. The rapid was formed by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-375" id="Pg_2-375"></a>[<a href="./images/2-375.png">375</a>]</span>
rocky barrier extending from north-west to south-east.
We had hilly and undulating country all the
way along, and the river wound about a great deal.</p>

<p>Col. Brazil was steering the first boat of the fleet
carefully as we went through the tortuous channel,
the entire fleet following us in good order. Picturesque
islands of truly tropical appearance were to be seen,
covered with tall burity palms, 30 to 40 ft. high, with
narrow channels between.</p>

<p>The heavy clouds which had collected to the north
suggested an approaching storm, but, as luck would
have it, the sky cleared at sunset. As we wound our
way among the many rocks reflected in the now still
waters of that vast river, the scene was really beautiful.</p>

<p>The channel through which Col. Brazil navigated
his boat was only 10 m. wide, with dangerous submerged
rocks. Mangabel, taken as a whole, was
an immense basin, 1,000 to 1,500 m. broad from west
to east, interspersed with elongated, rounded and flattened
rocks. It was indeed a most picturesque sight,
especially when all the trading boats were winding
their way at sunset descending the various rapids.</p>

<p>After going through a great channel, we went along
a large fissure from south-east to north-west, still in the
Mangabel rapid. The rock of that region was highly
ferruginous. That fissure was of great depth, and
absolutely free from rocks in the channel itself.</p>

<p>When we emerged from the fissure we were confronted
to the east on the right bank by two enormous
hemispherical domes 100 ft. high, grassy but absolutely
without a tree.</p>

<p>The rocky formation of the hills was apparent a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-376" id="Pg_2-376"></a>[<a href="./images/2-376.png">376</a>]</span>
little farther down stream, when going along the
great eastern channel of the river. On the left bank
we had hills with <i>campos</i> on their summit. All the
hills I noticed in that region had rounded backs.</p>

<p>I greatly admired the bearing of Col. Brazil as
we dashed down at a terrific speed through the most
intricate channel in the rapid, strewn with sharp rocks.
Had we touched one of those rocks it would have
meant the destruction of the boat, the loss of all the
valuable cargo and most of the crew, as the majority
of them could not swim.</p>

<p>There were three passages there, called respectively
the Casson, near the left bank; the Dos Ananas, in
the centre; and the channel da Terra Preta, which we
followed, on the right. At Lua Nova, the end of the
Mangabel rapid, the river turned in a sweeping curve
to the north, the rocks getting fewer and fewer until
eventually the river became quite clear of them, with
only high hills along both banks. Lua Nova was a
little settlement of five houses and a shed, some of
them whitewashed, with doors and windows painted
green. A small plantation of Indian corn, sugar-cane,
and <i>mandioca</i> had been made, the soil being
extremely fertile at that spot. We enjoyed a magnificent
view to the west and north-north-west, the
river there forming an elbow.</p>

<p class="figcenter">(Dr. Rey de Castro, Peruvian Consul at Manaos, in the centre of photograph.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Close by, on leaving that place, we found on our
right Lage's Point, where the rocky formation suddenly
ended, and with it the dangers of the Mangabel
rapids. Here there was a basin 1,500 m. wide, with
extensive sand-beaches of great beauty. After passing
the last row of rocks, extending from west to east, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-377" id="Pg_2-377"></a>[<a href="./images/2-377.png">377</a>]</span>
entire river bottom was of clean yellow sand, so that
the water appeared as limpid as crystal, while a few
moments before it looked of a dirty yellow&mdash;not
because it was really dirty, but because of the reflection
from the rocky river bottom.</p>

<p>From Praia Formosa, which we then saw on our
left side, the river was once more strewn with rocks,
but not in such quantities as at Mangabel. High hills
could be seen all along, which seemed as if they had
been formed by alluvial deposits left there when the
drainage from the high Matto Grosso plateau proceeded
down toward the north in a disorderly fashion,
until it found its way into the great fissures in the
earth's crust which now form the beds of those great
arteries, the Xingu, the Tapajoz, and the Madeira rivers.</p>

<p>I noticed that all the hills and undulations ran
from south to north or from north-west to south-east,
the southern slope being generally more elongated.
After passing on our left the trading sheds of Sobradinho
and S. Vicente, with their corrugated iron roofs&mdash;looking
to us the most civilized things we had ever
seen&mdash;we approached the Montanha, where another
rapid had to be negotiated.</p>

<p>During the night I was sleeping inside the cabin
of the boat, which Col. Brazil had placed at my disposal,
and where I had all the baggage which I had
saved from the forest. In the middle of the night all
of a sudden the boat sank in 5 or 6 ft. of water.
It was all I could do to scramble out of the cabin.
The boat had sprung a great leak as big as a man's
hand, which had been stopped up, and which had
suddenly opened&mdash;hence the misfortune.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-378" id="Pg_2-378"></a>[<a href="./images/2-378.png">378</a>]</span>
This sudden immersion in cold water gave me
another bad attack of fever, as I had to sit the entire
night in wet pyjamas while the crews of all the other
boats were summoned in order to raise the boat once
more, a work which lasted several hours.</p>

<p>Next morning when we departed Col. Brazil lent
me some of his clothes, while all my things were spread
on the roofs of the various boats to dry in the sun,
I never shall forget Col. Brazil's amusement and that
of his men when I unpacked some of the boxes, which
had once been watertight, and pulled out a dress-suit,
frock-coat, and other such stylish garments, now
all wet and muddy, and some twenty pairs of shoes,
all in a terrible condition, mildewed and soaked with
the moisture they had absorbed in the forest and
during the last immersion.</p>

<p>Near the tributary Montanha, on the left side of
the main stream, were two small rapids. A rich
rubber-producing land was situated a day and a half's
journey along that tributary. The best way to reach
it was from a place called El Frances, one of the
most charming spots I saw on the lower Tapajoz
River. The central hill at Montanha was 300 ft. high,
the hills around it from 200 to 300 ft. high.</p>

<p>Farther down we came to the Rio Jamanchin, a
tributary on the right side of the Tapajoz, which
entered the river where great sand-shallows occupied
nearly half the width of the stream.</p>

<p>Col. Brazil was the happy possessor of immense
concessions on that tributary stream&mdash;in fact as far
as the Tocantins River, a tributary on the left side of
the Jamanchin. He had already made a mule trail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-379" id="Pg_2-379"></a>[<a href="./images/2-379.png">379</a>]</span>
across that region in order to get over the difficulty
of the troublesome rapids which are to be found there,
such as those of Port&atilde;o, Cahy, and Apuhy. The
mineral wealth was also considerable, according to
the accounts I heard; while undoubtedly the production
of rubber could not be better.</p>

<p>This was the spot at which the river Tapajoz came
nearest to its eastern neighbour the river Xingu.
The <i>seringueiros</i> on the latter river constantly cross
over, following the Jamanchin in order to go down
to the Amazon by the Tapajoz. Rubber collectors
have found their way high up on the Xingu River&mdash;much
farther up than on the river Tapajoz.</p>

<p>On October 25th we went down first the Lim&atilde;o
rapid, and then the Burbure rapid. The river was
beautiful all along, with low hills on both sides. We
eventually arrived at Pimental, a fiendishly hot,
steamy, unhealthy place, where across a streamlet
was a station for the transhipment of rubber. The
place was on low ground, which became inundated
at high water. Another station was built some
200 m. off on high ground, which was used as a winter
station. The second station was at the beginning of
an excellent mule track which Col. Brazil had cut as
far as a place lower down the river called Bella Vista,
a distance of some 20 kil. He had imported at much
expense a number of mules for the service. All the
rubber was conveyed from that spot on mule-back,
as between Pimental and Bella Vista was a dangerous
rapid, on which many boats had been lost.</p>

<p>In the company of Col. Brazil I rode over that
distance, in intense pain owing to the weak state in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-380" id="Pg_2-380"></a>[<a href="./images/2-380.png">380</a>]</span>
which I was. When we came to the river again, over
great deposits of sand we saw a number of crocodiles
basking in the sun.</p>

<p>Bella Vista consisted of four neat double-storied
grey houses, two large white buildings, and some
temporary constructions of mud with palm-leaf roofs,
all of them situated on a high bank. The place was
at the entrance of a wide channel, dry and sandy.
When this was filled by the stream at high water a
long island was formed.</p>

<p>Bella Vista was a great point for us, for there we
should meet steam navigation again, Col. Brazil having
purchased a handsome steamer which performed the
service between that place and Belem (Para).</p>

<p class="fsc">The Launch "Rimac" on the Ucayalli River.</p>
<hr />
<p>I broke down altogether while there, and was
nursed with the tenderest care by the family of Mr.
Lage, who was in charge of that trading station. It
is difficult to imagine more kind-hearted, generous
people than these exiles in those deadly regions. All
the employ&eacute;s at the station were in a pitiable condition,
suffering from malarial fever.</p>

<p>When the steamer <i>Commandante Macedo</i> arrived&mdash;she
only came once a month in order to bring down
the rubber&mdash;I went in her to the first town we had
seen since leaving Diamantino, a place called Itaituba.
It seemed to us as if we had dropped into London or
Paris again, although the place merely consisted of
a few red-roofed houses, the walls of which were
gaily coloured, bright yellow, green, or white. Palm
trees of great size showed here and there beyond the
row of buildings as we approached the place on its
high site.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-381" id="Pg_2-381"></a>[<a href="./images/2-381.png">381</a>]</span>
Prominent along the river front were magnificently
vigorous mango trees, with luxuriant foliage. A brick
and stone church, unfinished, was visible, with a
great pile of bricks in front waiting in vain for money
and labour to complete it. The grand square, with
its pretty <i>Intendencia</i> coloured bright blue, formed
the end, on the west, of that most important "town"
on the Tapajoz. In the centre of the square was a
well-executed bust of Correa.</p>

<p>The most prominent feature of the place, however,
was the elevated landing-stage, some 30 ft. above the
level of the river at low water, erected there for loading
and unloading when the river rose. The town was
divided by three longitudinal avenues, the central
one also with rows of magnificent mango trees, which
indeed seemed to flourish at that place. I was particularly
struck by the wonderful tidiness and cleanliness,
the good drainage of the streets, and the upkeep
of the different houses, of which the people seemed
proud. Everybody was well off, owing to the rubber
industry, which had brought much wealth to the place.
Col. Brazil and his family have dedicated much time
and energy to embellishing the town, and no doubt
some day, when Itaituba is connected with proper
telegraphic and postal services, it will become an
important city, being the key, as it were, of the
Tapajoz River.</p>

<p>On November 5th I bade good-bye to my good
friend Col. Brazil, whose guest I had been since leaving
the forest, and for whose thoughtful hospitality I feel
deeply grateful. I presented him with my best rifle,
a very handsome weapon, which had accompanied me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-382" id="Pg_2-382"></a>[<a href="./images/2-382.png">382</a>]</span>
on several previous journeys, and which was the only
valuable thing remaining in my possession.</p>

<p>It was a new sensation for me to be steaming
down comfortably on a beautifully-kept steamer, as
spick-and-span as a private yacht. Her captain and
co-proprietor with Col. Brazil was Captain Macedo, a
man who had spent much time in Europe, and was
one of the most polished gentlemen I met in Brazil.</p>

<p>Now that my work was practically over, it was a
great relief to me to be basking in a cane chair upon
the deck, looking at the wonderful scenery opening
up before me as we went on. We passed a lovely
sand-beach, Capitary, then the immense bay of Boin,
and farther on the great rocks of Surucu&aacute;. Then
came in sight the headland called Punta de Cururu,
with the Serra of the same name upon it. Once or
twice the ship stopped at different sheds in order
to take up merchandise, but we only halted long
enough to get the cargo on board, and once more we
proceeded gaily down stream. It was wonderful how
one appreciated civilized ways of locomotion after
travelling for months and months, as we had done,
in the manner of prehistoric man.</p>

<p>In the evening, while we were sitting at dinner,
there was a big bump. We had run aground somewhat
heavily on a sand-dune. The captain rather
frightened me as he said that on a previous occasion
they had stuck on a sand-bank for several days
before they could get off. As luck would have it
that night, partly by the aid of a steel cable several
hundred metres long, which had been fastened to a number
of big trees on the shore, partly by her own power,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-383" id="Pg_2-383"></a>[<a href="./images/2-383.png">383</a>]</span>
we were able to back out and get her free. Only six
hours were wasted. The tide, which reaches a long
way up the Tapajoz River when the latter is low,
helped us a great deal. At high tide the level of the
water is raised more than one foot. It seemed amazing
that the tide of the ocean could extend its influence
by forcing the water back so far up the Amazon and
its tributaries.</p>

<p>Although the steamer on which I was did not
draw much water, being built specially for river
navigation, careful soundings had to be taken continually.
I well recollect the cries of the man at the
lead. When the man cried out "<i>Una bra&ccedil;a!</i>" (one
fathom), there was great excitement on board, and
we had to slow down to half speed or dead slow.
In the distance on the left bank in the haze could be
distinguished high hills, at the foot of which white
ribbon-like streaks were visible along the water.</p>

<p>The Barros do Tapayuna, a sand and mud bar,
extremely shallow, extended from the elongated island
of the same name right across the stream, there about
5 kil. wide. That spot was also called the <i>garganta</i>,
or throat of the Tapajoz, because at low water it
was impossible to get through, and it was necessary to
unload the steamer, the navigation being extremely
difficult.</p>

<p>"<i>Dos bra&ccedil;as!</i>" (two fathoms) cried the lead
man. "One and a half fathom!" he cried next, as
we went over the shallowest part of that sand-bar.</p>

<p>Although shallow, that part of the river was not
dangerous, because the bottom was of soft mud; not
so, however, farther on, where the shallow channel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-384" id="Pg_2-384"></a>[<a href="./images/2-384.png">384</a>]</span>
was strewn with plentiful rocks. Captain Macedo
had sensibly placed buoys and marks all over the most
dangerous places, so as to minimize the dangers of
navigation.</p>

<p>The river was magnificent farther down, where we
passed a great quadrangular rock of deep Indian red,
looking exactly like an immense square tower. Then
vertical rocks were to be seen all along the right
bank; while on the left bank, when we crossed over
to the other side of the river, were immense beaches
of beautiful sand. Above them were great stretches of
the most wonderful grass, upon which thousands of
cattle could graze&mdash;but not one animal was to be seen.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-384.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-384_th.jpg" alt="A Trail in the Andes." title="A Trail in the Andes." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">A Trail in the Andes.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was rather interesting to note that the formation
of the right bank was exactly the same as that of the
Pared&atilde;o Grande we had seen in Matto Grosso. Vertical
sides in great rectangles were noticeable, intersected
by passages&mdash;regular ca&ntilde;ons&mdash;where small huts could
be seen at the foot of the picturesque rocks, especially
at places where small streamlets entered the Tapajoz.
I was told that little lakes had formed beyond those
frontal rocky masses, the entrances to which were
blocked at low water by sand-bars. Beyond that row
of vertical red rocks was a more or less confused mass
of hills, some dome-like, others of a more elongated
form, but still with a well-rounded sky-line. The water
of the stream had now changed colour altogether,
and had become of a deep green. Islets could be seen
far, far away to the left side of the river, mere white
dots and lines along the water-line, most of them having
white sand-beaches around them; while on the right
bank the great red walls in sections continued for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-385" id="Pg_2-385"></a>[<a href="./images/2-385.png">385</a>]</span>
many miles. As we neared the mouth of the Tapajoz,
the river had the immense width of 14 kil. On the
right, after going through the Passagem dos Surucu&eacute;,
we passed the mountain of Jaguarary, which stood
prominent along a flat elevation on the right bank.</p>

<p>We halted in the afternoon at a picturesque little
place called Prainha&mdash;prettier than any I had seen
so far, because of its frontage battlement, with its
numerous staircases to allow the people of the various
houses to go down to the water. A tiny church stood
farther back on a prominence.</p>

<p>Late at night we arrived at Santarem, at the
junction of the Tapajoz River with the Amazon. At
that spot the man X and poor Benedicto insisted on
leaving me, so they received their full pay, and Benedicto
a very handsome present of money; after which they
disembarked. As the sum I paid Benedicto was a
considerable one, so that he might be well off for the
rest of his days, I warned him not to waste it in
buying all kinds of absurd things.</p>

<p>We halted at Santarem for several hours. What
was not my astonishment, just before we departed,
to find that Benedicto had gone into a store and had
spent over &pound;25 sterling in buying innumerable tins of
jam&mdash;in fact, he had bought up the entire supply
which was in the store! When I asked him what he
did that for, he said he was very fond of jam. With
his friends and a number of people he had quickly
collected round him, they opened tin after tin,
ravenously devouring the contents, so that within a
short time he would have none left.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Santarem</span> was an old settlement of no great interest.
It had a few relatively fine ancient buildings and
many ugly new ones.</p>

<p>Early on November 6th the steamer proceeded on
her way to Belem (Par&aacute;). On leaving Santarem we
first emerged into the great Amazon River, a regular
sea of fresh water, where we tossed about in a strong
north-easterly gale. Unless one knew, one never could
have imagined oneself on a river, as the stream was so
wide at that point that the opposite bank could not
be seen at all.</p>

<p>Things were a little better when we entered the
channel of Monte Alegre. On that channel was the little
town of the same name, half of the buildings being
along the water's edge, the other half on the summit
of a low hill near by. There is a sulphur spring there
with wonderful medicinal properties, and coal is also
said to be found.</p>

<p>A colony of Spaniards had been imported to work,
but they were dissatisfied and had left. Tobacco,
made up into fusiform sticks 6 ft. long and tied into
bundles, was exported from that place in considerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-387" id="Pg_2-387"></a>[<a href="./images/2-387.png">387</a>]</span>
quantities; the inhabitants were also engaged in
breeding cattle, growing Indian corn, and drying fish&mdash;the
<i>piraruc&uacute;</i> (<i>Vastres gigas</i>), a salmonoid vulgarly
called the cod-fish of the Amazon. A big trade was
done in that dried fish all over that region.</p>

<p>In the full moon of a glorious night we could discern
to the north a mountain region with elevations
of over 3,000 ft. Between those mountains&mdash;the
Serra de Almerin&mdash;and ourselves, lay a long flat island,
the vegetation on which was, for that particular
region, comparatively sparse. That island of mud
had formed during the last fifteen or twenty years,
and was at the time of my visit several kilometres
in length. It was called the Pesqueiro. Islands
have a way of forming in a very short time in the
Amazon, while others change their shape or disappear
altogether.</p>

<p>On November 7th we were facing the principal
outlet of the Amazon to the north-east. That main
estuary is, however, not as navigable as the one south
of it, through which most of the big ships pass. An
archipelago had formed at that spot. The fortress of
Matapa, very ancient, stood on the largest outlet.</p>

<p>We went through the channel called the Itoquara.
Another, the Tajapurozinho, was to the south, forming
a boundary on that side of the large island, which
we skirted to the north in the Itoquara channel. The
beautiful island of Uruttahi was now in sight, to the
north of the largest outlet. Like all other islands
in that neighbourhood, it was flat and of alluvial
formation.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the open waters, where the small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-388" id="Pg_2-388"></a>[<a href="./images/2-388.png">388</a>]</span>
ship upon which I was tossed about considerably, we
kept to the smaller channels between the islands,
going first through the channel of Lim&atilde;o and after
that through the Tajapuru. It was practically the
same course as the Itoquara, which was called by
different names in different parts. It was narrow
and tortuous, and required great skill in the navigation
of it; but it was extraordinarily deep&mdash;so deep that
all the big ocean steamers entering the Amazon
followed this channel in preference to the main outlet
of the river, which is not navigable owing to many
sandbanks.</p>

<p>We were there in a regular maze of islands, composed
mostly of mud and of recent formation, not
more than one or two feet above the water. For
Brazil, they were fairly thickly inhabited, miserable
huts being visible every few hundred metres or so.</p>

<p>On our right as we went through we had a luxuriant
growth of <i>mirichi</i> palms, some of great height and
close together&mdash;a regular forest of them. At the first
glance as you looked at those islands, it seemed as
if all along the coast-line a low palisade had been
erected. It was indeed a natural palisade of <i>aninga</i>,
an aquatic plant growing in profusion on the edge of
mud-banks. The <i>aninga</i> is said to contain a powerful
poison, the touch of which produces violent itching.</p>

<p>All the houses and huts on those islands necessarily
had to be built on high piles, as the country was constantly
inundated, the tide rising and falling some
three feet in that particular channel.</p>

<p class="fsc">Campas Indian Children.</p>
<hr />
<p>As we neared the mouth of the river, with Para
as our objective, we first saw the lighthouse of Buyussu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-389" id="Pg_2-389"></a>[<a href="./images/2-389.png">389</a>]</span>
in the immense bay which takes its name from the
little town of Coralhina. Both this town and that
of Boa Vista were on the left side of us, on the great
island of Marajo. On the right the island of Oya
was visible, and the island of Araras. Between the
light of Buyussu and the island of Oya opened the
great bay of Melgasso.</p>

<p>Considering the amount of navigation that went
through, it was amazing to see how badly lighted
that river was&mdash;the two lights, such as the one at
Buyussu, and the one at Mandy, at the entrance of the
bay of Marajo, being no bigger than and not so brilliant
as the ordinary street oil-lamp in an English or French
village. I understand that all ships navigating the
Amazon have to pay a large tax on each journey for
the maintenance of the lighthouses on that immense
waterway. It is quite criminal that no proper lights
are constructed in order to protect the safety of the
passengers and the valuable cargoes which go by that
important water route.</p>

<p>More picturesque than most of the scenery I had
so far witnessed on the Amazon was the narrow Foro
da Jararaca. From the lamp-post&mdash;it cannot in all
honesty be called a lighthouse&mdash;of Mandy, we made
for the other lamp-post of Capin; and from this for
the third lamp-post of Arrozal, navigation being
most difficult in that part. From there we steered
direct for the Farol de Cutijuba, a light somewhat
more respectable than the others at the entrance of
the Barra of Par&aacute;.</p>

<p>After going through the bay of Coralhina we did
not follow the great channel that was before us, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-390" id="Pg_2-390"></a>[<a href="./images/2-390.png">390</a>]</span>
skirted the island of Concep&ccedil;&atilde;o to the left, passing
between it and Paketta Island. After that island we
found ourselves in the bay of Jappelin, so named after
a bird of that region, which builds an elongated nest.</p>

<p>Having passed the Cutijuba Island, and then the
Taxipa Island on our left, in the early morning
we entered between the islands of Arabiranga and
Jararakinha. The larger vessels generally follow a
course outside on the east of this island before entering
the large bay of Marajo.</p>

<p>We could plainly see that we were approaching
a large city, for quantities of little sailing boats were
now visible on the water. Signs of civilization were
beginning to appear on the island of Arabiranga. A
brick and tile kiln, which supplied Belem (Par&aacute;)
with most of its building materials, had been
established there. Alongside the island could be seen
a lot of steamers belonging to the Amazon River
Company. Beyond was the bay of Guajara, with the
city and many ocean steamers looming in the distance.</p>

<p>On November 18th we steamed into the bay, and
there stood the city of Belem (Par&aacute;) before us, while
the noise of the town began to get louder and louder
as we approached the dock. That sound was welcome
to me in a way, and at the same time worrying, after
the dead silence I had been accustomed to for the
last many months.</p>

<p>A swarm of robber-porters invaded the steamer
the moment we came alongside the pier. The bustle,
the loud shouting, the pushing, seemed most irritating.
Ill as I was, for a few moments I almost contemplated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-391" id="Pg_2-391"></a>[<a href="./images/2-391.png">391</a>]</span>
the idea of turning back toward the virgin forest.
The heat was oppressive, the bells of the tramways
jangled all the time, the rattle of the medi&aelig;val
carriages on the cobble-stones of the pavement was
distressing.</p>

<p>Things were not pleasanter when I put up in the
best hotel, where the best room I could get was not
unlike a coal-cellar. We will not speak of the food.</p>

<p>Those aspiring efforts at semi-civilization were to
my mind ten times worse than no civilization at all.
Had it not been for the extreme kindness of my friend
Commandante Macedo, of Mr. Ross, the manager of
the London and Brazilian Bank, and of the British
Consul, I would have left the place that same day.</p>

<p>At Belem I dismissed Alcides, Antonio, and white
Filippe, paying their full passage by sea and railway
and full wages up to the day of their arrival at their
respective homes. They had certainly many faults,
and had not behaved well to me; but I am given to
weigh matters justly, and there was no doubt that
those men had endured terrific hardships and, willingly
or unwillingly, had carried through quite a herculean
task. I therefore not only paid them the high wages
upon which I had agreed, but I gave each a handsome
present of money.</p>

<p>The three men duly signed receipts and unsolicited
certificates, in which they declared that during the
entire journey they had been treated by me in a
generous manner and with every possible thoughtfulness
and consideration.</p>

<p>As they had not been able to spend a single penny
since we had left Diamantino they had accumulated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-392" id="Pg_2-392"></a>[<a href="./images/2-392.png">392</a>]</span>
a considerable sum of cash. I warned them, as I
had done with Benedicto, to be careful and not waste
their money. They went out for a walk. Some hours
later they returned, dressed up in wonderful costumes
with fancy silk ties, patent leather shoes, gold chains
and watches, and gaudy scarf-pins. In a few hours
they had wasted away nearly the entire sum I had
paid out to them. Everything was extremely expensive
in Par&aacute;&mdash;certainly three or four times the price
which things would fetch in London or New York.</p>

<p>Two days later white Filippe and Antonio embarked
for Rio de Janeiro, with hardly a word of
farewell to me. Alcides refused to travel on the same
steamer with his companions, and left by a later one.</p>

<p>The city of Par&aacute; is much too well known for me
to enter into a long description of it. Since its discovery
in the year 1500, when Vincente Yanes Pinzon
cast anchor in the Mara&ntilde;on or Amazon, Belem has
become a beautiful city. As everybody knows, it is
the capital of the Par&aacute; province, which has an area
of 1,149,712 sq. kil. Geographically, Belem could not
be situated in a better position, and is bound some day
to become the most flourishing city of the Brazilian
Republic. It is undoubtedly the key to the great
Amazon River, although it is not actually at the mouth
of the Amazon, but 138 kil. from the ocean. Through
it is bound to pass the trade not only of that riverine
portion of Brazil, but also of Peru and Bolivia.</p>

<p class="fsc">Campas Old Woman and her Son.</p>
<hr />
<p>Belem (Par&aacute;) is mostly known to Europeans as
the nest of yellow fever. During the last few years
it has been freed absolutely from that scourge, the
cases of yellow fever being now few and far between,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-393" id="Pg_2-393"></a>[<a href="./images/2-393.png">393</a>]</span>
owing to the wonderful progress made by hygiene
and the praiseworthy efforts made by the Province
to keep the city in a healthy condition.</p>

<p>The population of Par&aacute; is 192,230 inhabitants.
Many spacious and handsome edifices, such as the
Government buildings and the professional Institutes,
do great credit to the city; while the Peace Theatre
is one of the finest in Brazil. Many private mansions
are of some architectural beauty, and some of the
new avenues and the municipal gardens are handsome.
The slaughter-house, the iron market, etc., are quite
up to date, and the city even boasts of a crematorium.</p>

<p>My object in coming to Belem (Par&aacute;) was merely
to see my men safely on board on their return to the
Minas Geraes and Goyaz Provinces; also to buy some
new cameras and instruments, so that I could start
on the second part of my expedition, following the
entire course of the Amazon almost up to its source,
then cross over the Andes and reach the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>My English friends in Par&aacute; tried to dissuade me
from attempting the journey, as I was in a pitiful
condition. What was worse, civilization, instead of
making me feel better, was smashing me up altogether.
Every day I was getting weaker and weaker, and more
exhausted. I had hardly strength to walk about, less
still to go up or down stairs. Beri-beri commenced
to develop in my right foot, and added to my other
trials.</p>

<p>The English consul told me it was absolute folly
to try and proceed on such a long journey in such
an exhausted state.</p>

<p>Having bought fresh clothes and cameras for my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-394" id="Pg_2-394"></a>[<a href="./images/2-394.png">394</a>]</span>
new expedition, I left Par&aacute; on November 12th at noon
on the excellent ship <i>Anthony</i> of the Booth line, on
my way up the Amazon to Manaos.</p>

<p>I will not attempt here to give a description of
that amazing river the Amazon&mdash;amazing because it
is very big and not because it is beautiful, for indeed
I do not believe that in all my travels I have ever
seen a river quite so ugly and uninteresting as the
Amazon.</p>

<p>First of all, it is so big that you seldom see both
sides of the river at a time; its waters are muddy and
filthy; its climate is damp, oppressive and unhealthy;
its vegetation, when you are near enough the banks
to see it, is entangled, half-rotted, and smelly. All
along one's nostrils are offended by the fetid odour
of mud and decayed vegetable matter.</p>

<p>People in Europe seem imbued with the idea that,
as you go along the Amazon, you must be attracted
by the great number of birds of beautiful plumage,
insects and butterflies of all sizes and amazing colours.
Occasionally, especially in the early morning and
at sunset, one does notice perhaps a flock of green
paroquets with yellow foreheads, notable for their
peculiar, clumsy, rapid wing-flapping flight and their
harsh shrieks when settling on the trees. Occasionally,
too, one may see a family of larger parrots dashing
across the sky; but, indeed, birds in the lower Amazon
are not plentiful by any means, nor, indeed, is their
plumage particularly attractive, most birds, except the
parrots, being small and very soberly tinted.</p>

<p>As for the melodious songs of birds which civilized
people always imagine in the equatorial forest&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-395" id="Pg_2-395"></a>[<a href="./images/2-395.png">395</a>]</span>
song that will set you dreaming while you are basking
under palm trees&mdash;the actual traveller will find the
greatest disappointment of all in that respect. With
one or two exceptions, such as the <i>Troglodytes fuscus</i>,
a small brown wren which emits sweet musical notes,
most birds of the Amazon have grating voices and harsh
piercing whistles, or monotonous deep repetitions of
two or three funereal notes which are more apt to
drive you insane than to fascinate you. Among the
most unmusical singers of the lower Amazon may be
counted the several families of finches and fly-catchers,
and the local thrushes, which feed on ants.</p>

<p>Similar disappointment awaits one in regard to the
vegetation. People imagine Brazil a land of beautiful
flowers, the forest made up of immense trees with
luxuriant foliage, overladen with parasitic orchids&mdash;eternally
in bloom, of course, in the dreamy minds
of the untravelled, and just waiting to be picked
and to be placed in one's buttonhole. The sky,
naturally, over such a forest, could only be swarming
with birds of all sizes, with plumage of the richest
colours and hues; and what else could such a luxuriant
country have in the way of butterflies and insects
than some which resemble precious gems in the
iridescent tones of their wings and bodies?</p>

<p>That is what people imagine. The following is
what you really see.</p>

<p>The trees, overcrowded everywhere, far from being
gigantic, are, instead, mean-looking and an&aelig;mic&mdash;not
unlike the pallid, overgrown youth of the over-populated
slums of a great city. Orchids? Yes,
there are plenty of orchids about, but you never see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-396" id="Pg_2-396"></a>[<a href="./images/2-396.png">396</a>]</span>
them unless you go on a special search for them with
a high ladder or some other such means of climbing
high trees. In any case, you would not detect them
unless you had the eye of an expert. It is well not
to forget that in tropical climates, as in temperate
zones, plants are not always in bloom when you happen
to be passing. As for the butterflies, you seldom see
any at all in the actual forest.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most common birds of the
Amazon is a kind of grey-eyed, noisy, mimicking
magpie, locally called <i>guache</i> or <i>japim</i> or <i>jappelin</i>
(<i>Cassicus icterranotus</i>), quite amusing with its energetic
movements, its observant habits, its familiar interest
in everything and everybody, and its facility for reproducing
correctly enough sounds which momentarily
attract its attention. The wonderful activity of
its slender body, clothed in velvety black, neatly-groomed
yellow feathers, and its charming wickedness
make it, perhaps, one of the most attractive
birds near towns and settlements on the river. It
builds elongated nests which are 20 to 30 in. in
length, the entrance to which is in the lower portion.
They are suspended from the branches of
trees. As I have said, the large bay near the
mouth of the Amazon has been named in honour
of this bird.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-396.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-396_th.jpg" alt="Campas Indian Woman." title="Campas Indian Woman." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Campas Indian Woman.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another bird of great interest is the <i>araruna</i> (or
<i>Macrocerus hyacinthinus</i>), a magnificent macaw of
great size, which is perhaps the rarest and most beautiful
found in the interior of Brazil from the northern
end of the central plateau as far as the Amazon River.
Its feathers are of a soft, metallic, dark greyish-blue,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-397" id="Pg_2-397"></a>[<a href="./images/2-397.png">397</a>]</span>
almost black, except round the eyes, where the uncovered
white skin shows through. I have seen these
birds in flight on four or five different occasions
on the Tapajoz River, and tried in vain to secure a
specimen. I generally saw them in couples, flying at
a great height and speed. These birds are extremely
intelligent, and become most affectionate and faithful
companions to a considerate master. In fact, they
will attack any one endeavouring to get near their
owners. Their beaks are extremely strong. When
in captivity they are disastrous to one's belongings,
as they seem to possess an irresistible desire to
crush and tear anything they see. They can chip
off pieces of furniture made of the hardest wood
with considerable ease. This is easily understood
when you can see them crush into fragments the
extremely hard nuts of the <i>Acrocomia lasiopatha</i>, on
which they principally live.</p>

<p>Sir Roger Casement, of Putumayo atrocities fame,
whom I had the pleasure of meeting at Manaos,
possessed a most beautiful specimen of the <i>Macrocerus
hyacinthinus</i>. It was most touching to see the pathetic
devotion which existed between master and bird
and <i>vice versa</i>. Only the people of the hotel where
we both stayed did not appreciate the magnificent
blue-black visitor, for when its master was out it
spent all its time chipping off pieces from tables and
chairs, and took the greatest pride and delight in
flinging forks, knives and spoons off the dining-room
tables, and tearing the menus to strips. The Brazilian
waiters, in their caution to maintain their own anatomy
intact, did not dare go near it; for the bird, even on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-398" id="Pg_2-398"></a>[<a href="./images/2-398.png">398</a>]</span>
hearing remarks made on its behaviour, would let
itself down the sides of chairs and defiantly proceed
to attack the intruders.</p>

<p>Similar but larger and more beautiful than this
macaw is the <i>ararama</i>, extremely rare and perfectly
black. The natives say that it is impossible to keep
it in captivity as it is quite untameable. I saw a
couple of these birds. They were really magnificent&mdash;certainly
3 ft. in length from the tip of the beak to
the end of the tail.</p>

<p>When the steamer was close enough to the banks
or an island we occasionally saw small groups of <i>assahy</i>
palms (<i>Euterpe oleracea</i>) 20 to 30 ft. high, with
smooth stems and feather-like foliage. Other palms,
equally graceful, with stems like polished columns
and delicately-cut fronds aloft, were also to be seen;
but otherwise most of the vegetation was entangled
and untidy.</p>

<p>From the trees hung liane in festoons or suspended
like cords. Creepers of all kinds smothered the trunks
and branches of the trees, which seemed to struggle
for a little life and air; while, when we had an opportunity
of examining the branches of the trees a little
closer, we could see absolute swarms of parasites
covering every bough.</p>

<p>Near some of the houses could be seen the <i>Musa
paradisiaca</i>, the most common kind of banana palm
in that region, with its green leaves ten to twelve feet
long reflecting beautiful shades like silk velvet when
caressed by the wind. I saw one or two specimens
of the bread-fruit tree, with its digitated foliage, and
several kinds of pine-apple plants (<i>Bromelia</i>)&mdash;some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-399" id="Pg_2-399"></a>[<a href="./images/2-399.png">399</a>]</span>
with leaves toothed along their edges, others shaped
more like the blade of a long knife.</p>

<p>I was in great pain, and could not observe much.
Also, most of the time we were at a great distance
from the banks, and the river was so wide that it was
almost like being in mid-ocean.</p>

<p>On November 14th we passed Obidos, at the mouth
of the Rio Trombetas, the narrowest point, where the
river went through a channel only 2,000 m. broad,
but of extreme depth. The channel was formed by
a depression between two hillocks 250 ft. high or so.
The settlement of Obidos consisted of two long white
buildings near the water, and a series of stores. To
the left of the village as we looked at it was a high
cliff extending for some 2,000 m. up stream over a
beautiful beach. The cliff showed patches of red
and yellow rock of a brilliant colour, the lower strata
being of a deep red and clearly defined, the upper ones
of a raw sienna colour, the dividing-line between the
two colours being somewhat undulating. There was
dense forest on the summit of the cliff. A good
deal of vegetation had crept down and was clinging
to the side of the cliff.</p>

<p>A little white church with a pointed spire stood
on the highest point of the cliff, close to the town.
Behind the cliff rose a hill of some height, upon which
the better houses, with red-tiled roofs, were situated.
A wide road led up to them.</p>

<p>The water of the stream was of a dirty yellow,
and very turbulent owing to the strong wind that
was blowing and the violent current. Proceeding
up stream, we then came to a hill 300 ft. high on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-400" id="Pg_2-400"></a>[<a href="./images/2-400.png">400</a>]</span>
right, which ended abruptly in an almost vertical
red and yellow cliff plunging into the water. On
the opposite side of the river, along the narrow neck,
were lowlands, quite open and scantily wooded, over
which rose great columns of black smoke, caused by
the natives burning down the forest in order to prepare
the land for their plantations. It was at this point
that the entire volume of the Amazon could be gauged
at a glance. As you looked up stream a long bluish
line of low forest could be perceived over the gradually
expanding deep yellow river. Dozens upon dozens of
columns of smoke were visible. When night came
the effects of those forest fires, with the reflection of
the light upon the low clouds and in the water, were
very weird and beautiful.</p>

<p>Greetings were occasionally exchanged upon the
river as a big ocean steamer went by, or an over-enthusiastic
captain let off rockets, which brought
all the passengers from the dinner-table to the port-holes.
Farther on we came to a pretty plantation
on the left with innumerable banana palms crowded
together, and some cocoa trees. At one time the
exportation of cocoa from that section of the Amazon
between Obidos and Santarem was considerable&mdash;some
8,000 kilos yearly. I was told that that industry has
now gone down a great deal, and not more than
4,000 kilos were exported in 1911.</p>

<p class="fsc">Campas Man, Woman and Child.</p>
<hr />
<p>As we went farther up stream we passed alluvial
banks of comparatively recent formation, in some
places only one foot above the water and liable to
constant inundation&mdash;in other places 10 or 12 ft.
above the stream, and exposing an abrupt crumbling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-401" id="Pg_2-401"></a>[<a href="./images/2-401.png">401</a>]</span>
section of grey clay on a lower stratum with a narrow
band of raw sienna colour. This yellow band rarely
exceeded a thickness of 1 ft. We had an object-lesson
here, where the banks were eroded by water
and were gradually crumbling away, of the reason
why the trees were so an&aelig;mic and generally died.
The roots, instead of burrowing deep into the ground,
spread out laterally in a horizontal position quite
close to the surface of the ground. That night we had
a beautiful effect of rain and smoke and the reflection
from the fires, a wonderful study of reds and yellows
and dark blues which would have fascinated the
immortal painter Turner.</p>

<p>Farther on we passed an island 6 ft. above the
water with beautiful green grass upon it, wonderful
grazing land, and no trees whatever. On both sides
of the channel we followed, in fact, we had fine open
country all around, which seemed excellent for grazing
purposes.</p>

<p>More interesting to me than the river itself were
the wonderful effects of the ever-changing light in
the sky. I saw no more the wonderful radiations
which had given me so much pleasure in Matto Grosso,
but we beheld here a great haze of delicate tones up
to a great height and a light blue sky above it. The
clouds seemed to possess no well-defined form, but
were more like masses of mist, the edges blending
gradually with the blue of the sky. Only to the west
was there an attempt at globular formation in the
clouds. The clouds of heavy smoke which rose and
rolled about over the landscape helped to render the
otherwise monotonous scene a little more picturesque.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-402" id="Pg_2-402"></a>[<a href="./images/2-402.png">402</a>]</span>
Farther up stream we reached on the right a long
island almost absolutely free from trees, except at
its western end, where a miserable growth of sickly
trees covered its point. Beyond was a beautiful spit
of red sand some 2,000 m. long.</p>

<p>On November 15th we reached Itaquatiara, where
the banks of the river were much higher than usual
on the right side. I was much struck by the sight of
a lot of fallen timber lying about on the slopes of the
high bank, and by that of innumerable logs of wood
floating on the water, quite an unusual sight in
Brazilian waters. Itaquatiara was placed geographically
on a most convenient site, opposite the mouth
of the great Madeira River. Now that the Madeira-Mamore
railway is completed, bringing down the
trade of Bolivia and of the Acre territory, there
is no doubt that it will become a most important
trading centre. To my mind it is bound to supplant
Manaos, which is very inconveniently situated, not on
the Amazon River itself but on the tributary Rio Negro.</p>

<p>All the rubber which goes down the Madeira River
has so far been conveyed to Manaos by a great detour,
involving much expense and time. In the future,
I think, when Itaquatiara has developed into a big
city, and proper arrangements are made for landing
and storing cargoes, it is certain to become a most
important centre of commerce. Land is already going
up in value tremendously, although Manaos has waged
war against the growth of a town at that spot, which
will be inimical to her own interests.</p>

<p>As is well known, the Madeira-Mamore railway
was built from Porto Velho, on the Madeira River,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-403" id="Pg_2-403"></a>[<a href="./images/2-403.png">403</a>]</span>
around and along a series of rapids and waterfalls
which rendered navigation most difficult, as far as
Guajara Merim, on the river Mamore, a mere continuation
of the Madeira River. The construction
of the railway had long been contemplated by the
Brazilian and Bolivian Governments, but it was a
difficult matter owing to the dense forest and the
unhealthy climate, which equals, if it does not even
surpass, the deadliness of Panama in the time of the
French. The works of the railway were begun as
long ago as 1878 by Collings Brothers, who were then
contractors, but nothing effectively was done until
the Brazilian Government, fully realizing the necessity
of opening up that rich country, especially after the
purchase from Bolivia of the Acre Territory, perhaps
one of the richest regions on earth as far as rubber is
concerned, entered into a contract with a Brazilian
engineer named Catambry, to build the railway. The
Brazilian engineer transferred the contract to Mr.
Percival Farquhar, who, in his turn, organized the
Madeira-Mamore Company, entrusting the actual
construction of the railway to Messrs. May, Jeckill
&amp; Randolph.</p>

<p>They started work in July, 1907, with preliminary
engineering, the actual construction not beginning
until January 1908. Work began with one engine,
a Baldwin locomotive rebuilt, which had been there
since 1878. Gradually the number of engines&mdash;all
Baldwin locomotives&mdash;was increased to twelve.
During the construction six tugs and eleven lighters
were used on the Madeira River for handling the
material. The contractors took into Brazil during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-404" id="Pg_2-404"></a>[<a href="./images/2-404.png">404</a>]</span>
the four and a half years occupied in the construction
from 43,000 to 45,000 men, although they never had
more than 5,000 men working at any one time. Many,
indeed, were the deaths registered, and the steamers
were constantly bringing back men laid up with fever.
The supplies for those men had all to be brought
from Europe and America, except sugar and coffee,
as nothing could be obtained in the country itself.
The four chief engineers were all Americans, Mr.
Randolph and Mr. Jeckill, who were at the head of
the entire concern, spending all their time on the
line in progress or at their head office in Manaos,
which was mostly in charge of Mr. May. One chief
surgeon, Dr. Carl Lovelace, handled all the hospital
work, with the assistance of fifteen physicians; but
innumerable were the lives lost from yellow fever
and beri-beri, the two most prevalent diseases in that
fatal country.</p>

<p>Before the railway was built it was necessary to
unload the <i>battell&atilde;os</i> or trading boats thirty-eight
times during the journey at the thirty-eight different
rapids and falls on the way. The journey over the
rapids took not less than forty days. I shall not speak
of the constant danger to boats, their crews and merchandise.
Now by the railway the entire journey
occupies from eight to ten hours. The length of the
completed railway, now in full working order, is
364 kil. The last rail was laid on April 30th, 1912,
when Mrs. Jeckill drove the last and golden spike&mdash;an
honour which no other white woman, I believe,
has ever had in so inhospitable a country.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Attacked by Beri-beri&mdash;A Journey up the Madeira River to the Relief
of Filippe the Negro and Recovery of Valuable Baggage left with
him&mdash;Filippe paid off&mdash;A Journey up the River Solime&otilde;s&mdash;Iquitos</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">I arrived</span> in Manaos in the evening of November 15th.
I was very ill indeed, my right foot so swollen that I
could hardly stand on it, and so painful that I could
not put on a shoe or even a slipper, so that I had to
hop about with only a sock over it. The doctor on
board had told me that I was suffering from beri-beri,
and although I tried not to believe him I was gradually
forced to the conclusion that he was right. In fact,
atrophy set in by degrees&mdash;one of the characteristics
of beri-beri being that after a time you feel no pain
at all. You can dig a pin into the affected part, or
pluck off all the hairs without feeling the slightest
pain. I was in a bad way, although I never laid up
for an entire day. From the moment I arrived I
"got busy," to use an American expression, in order
to go to the rescue of Filippe the negro and another
man I had left in charge of my valuable baggage near
the mouth of the Canuma River, a tributary of the
Madeira. It was necessary for me to borrow or charter
a steam launch for one or two days, so that I could
save men and baggage. I applied to the Governor of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-406" id="Pg_2-406"></a>[<a href="./images/2-406.png">406</a>]</span>
the Amazonas, who had received telegraphic instructions
from the Central Government to give me every
possible assistance. When I called upon him he said
he was not the "black servant" of the President of
the Republic; that he was practically an independent
ruler, and would obey nobody's orders or instructions,
especially from the Central Government.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-406.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-406_th.jpg" alt="On the Andes: an Elevated Trail overlooking a Foaming Torrent." title="On the Andes: an Elevated Trail overlooking a Foaming Torrent." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">On the Andes: an Elevated Trail overlooking a Foaming Torrent.</p>
<p class="figcenter">(See arch cut in the rock.)</p>
<hr />
<p>I told him that the work I had done was principally
for the good of Brazil; that all I asked him was to
help me to save the lives of two Brazilian citizens, and
the maps, photographs, etc., which would be useful
chiefly to Brazilians, whatever their political views
were. I would gladly pay out of my own pocket,
within reasonable bounds, all expenses in connection
with the trip. If I had applied to him it was only
because I had found it impossible at Manaos to charter
a steam launch.</p>

<p>I spread out before the Governor a map of South
America, showing the journey I had taken from Rio
de Janeiro to Manaos marked in red. The Governor,
who had evidently never seen a map before, turned
it upside down, mistook the entire map of South
America for a map of his own Province, and seemed
to be under the impression that the Amazon had its
birth close to Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>A bitter enemy of all foreigners, especially Englishmen,
the Governor was detested by everybody, and
was at open war with the Commandante of the Federal
troops in the town. All the money which should
have been spent in embellishing or improving the
town, was mis-spent in keeping a large army of police&mdash;over
2,000 men, I believe&mdash;for his personal protection.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-407" id="Pg_2-407"></a>[<a href="./images/2-407.png">407</a>]</span>
My audience with the Governor did not last long,
and I paid him back in his own coin. He immediately
turned round then, with great courtesy begging me
to stay and talk matters over, and said that he
would be delighted to be of use to me in showing
me around the city. I merely turned my back upon
him, as I would on any nonentity, and limped out of
the palace. Several messages were sent to me afterwards,
which I treated with the contempt they deserved.</p>

<p>As nearly all the launches in the place belonged
to the Government, I had then to apply to the Commandante
of the flotilla of the Government boats.
It will be easily understood that my anxiety was
great to go and rescue my men; so that on leaving the
palace I immediately proceeded to the private house
of this gentleman&mdash;a great friend of the Governor, I
learned afterwards. On sending in my card at five
o'clock in the afternoon I was kept waiting a little
time, then there appeared a yellow-faced individual
in his pyjamas, muttering words which I should not
like to repeat.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he said to me. "Do you
not know that I sleep from twelve to six every afternoon?
What do you mean by disturbing me? I am
sure you would not disturb officers of your own Navy
in this way!"</p>

<p>I very politely answered that the officers of my Navy
were well known for being wide awake at all times,
and not for sleeping the whole day as well as the
entire night. When I explained to him, and presented
the order from the Minister of Marine requesting
any officer of the Brazilian Navy to give every possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-408" id="Pg_2-408"></a>[<a href="./images/2-408.png">408</a>]</span>
assistance, he told me that none of his boats were
in a condition to move out; furthermore they were
needed, as great political trouble was expected in the
city.</p>

<p>I was beginning to feel anxious, as in my weak
state it would have been a serious matter for me to
undertake the river journey in a small rowing-boat,
which journey would have occupied several weeks,
when I could have done the whole thing in two or
three days at the most in a steam launch. Even a
rowing-boat was not obtainable unless you purchased
it outright, and if you obtained the boat you could
not obtain the men to row it.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how many things in the world
depend on absolute chance. When I returned, sadly
disappointed, to the hotel, I met a Swiss gentleman,
Dr. Alberto Maso, who was in the employ of the
Brazilian Government as delegate of the Minister of
Agriculture for the Territory of the Acre. I had met
him in Rio de Janeiro a year before. I told him what
had happened that day with the Governor and the
Commandante of the Flotilla. Dr. Maso immediately
took the matter in hand.</p>

<p>That same evening there was a meeting of the
Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Commercial do Amazonas, a most useful
society in Manaos composed of the cleverest and
soundest business men of that place. I was presented
to the President, Mr. J. G. Araujo, and to Dr. Bertino
Miranda, the honorary secretary&mdash;the latter a man
of letters of great distinction, well known not only in
his own country but in Latin countries all over Europe
as well.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-409" id="Pg_2-409"></a>[<a href="./images/2-409.png">409</a>]</span>
I was received by these gentlemen and the other
members of the Association with the greatest consideration,
and before I left that evening they assured
me that they would procure a launch for me with which
to go and rescue my men.</p>

<p>The next morning, in fact, I was taken to call
on the Commandante of the Federal troops, who
willingly and most courteously placed at my disposal
his steam launch. A delay of several days took place,
as unfortunately the steam launch had lost her propeller
and it was necessary to make a new one. Also
the engine had to be repaired, and a crew had to be
engaged&mdash;a task which gave all those concerned a
considerable amount of trouble.</p>

<p>I had, of course, to pay for the maintenance of the
crew during the journey, and it cost me nearly a hundred
pounds to fit her out with all the plates, knives,
cooking utensils, and other paraphernalia necessary
for her crew of sixteen men. In any other country
three men would have been more than sufficient to
run a launch of that size.</p>

<p>I also had to employ at my own expense a pilot&mdash;no
steamboat was allowed to go without one&mdash;whom
I had to pay at the rate of &pound;7 15<i>s.</i> sterling a day. A
cook had to be employed for the crew, as none of
the sailors could be induced to condescend to be the
chef. Two applicants were eventually found. One who
was willing to do the cooking at a salary of &pound;3 10<i>s.</i>
a day, his chief ability, said he, consisting in boiling
rice and fish. Another fellow eventually undertook
the job at a salary of &pound;1 10<i>s.</i> a day, he being willing
to do the cooking at such a small salary as he said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-410" id="Pg_2-410"></a>[<a href="./images/2-410.png">410</a>]</span>
he had never in his life cooked before, and he did not
know whether we should care for his cooking or not.
It must not for one moment be believed that these
men were trying to cheat me, and putting on prices,
for indeed these are the current rates for everybody
who wishes to travel in those regions. The cost of
commodities of any kind in Manaos was excessive,
and went beyond even the limits of robbery. I went
into a chemist's shop to purchase a small bottle of
quinine tablets, worth in England perhaps eightpence
or a shilling. The price charged there was &pound;2 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Principally owing to the Booth Line Steamship
Company and the allied companies, Manaos has become
a good-sized place. The Harbour Works and
the works made by the Manaos Improvements, Ltd.,
have been a great boon to that place, and have made
it almost as civilized as a third-class European city.
But obstacles have been placed in the way of honest
foreign companies carrying on their work successfully,
the unscrupulous behaviour of the Governor and the
attitude of the mob having proved serious drawbacks
to the development of the place.</p>

<p>Large sums of money have been wasted in building
a strawberry-coloured theatre of immense size and of
appalling architectural lines, on the top of which
has been erected a tiled dome of gigantic proportions
over an immense water-tank in order to protect the
theatre against fire. The water-tank was calculated
to let down a great cascade of water, a regular
Niagara, on the flames&mdash;as well as on the spectators, I
presume. After it had been built it was discovered
that if water were let into the tank, its weight would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-411" id="Pg_2-411"></a>[<a href="./images/2-411.png">411</a>]</span>
be enough to bring down the entire upper part of the
theatre; so that it could never be filled at all.</p>

<p>Except for one or two short avenues, which reminded
one of the suburbs of new North American
cities, there was nothing worth seeing in Manaos.
The shops were almost entirely those of jewellers,
gunsmiths, sweet-sellers, and chemists. It was in
this place that the poor <i>seringueiros</i>, on their return
from rubber collecting, were in a few hours robbed of
all the money they had made during several months'
hard work. There was only one redeeming feature
in Manaos: the British and American business men
in the place were most charming and hospitable in
every possible way.</p>

<p>It was on December 3rd, 1911, that everything
was ready. The hour of departure had been fixed for
ten o'clock in the evening. I went on board at the
appointed time, but the captain of the launch and the
crew refused to put out of the anchorage, as they said
they would not go unless some extra men were employed.
One of the pipes of the engine had been
wilfully damaged, so that delay was caused, and we
could not possibly start until it had been repaired.
The captain of the launch had worried me for several
days. He was in a constant state of intoxication.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On December 4th, at 11 p.m., I was actually able
to make my departure from Manaos on the launch
<i>Amazonas</i>. I took in tow a rowing-boat which had
been lent me by the representative of the Minister of
Agriculture in Manaos.</p>

<p>By 8.30 in the morning of December 5th we en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-412" id="Pg_2-412"></a>[<a href="./images/2-412.png">412</a>]</span>tered
the mouth of the Madeira River. I was surprised
at the sudden change in the appearance of the two
rivers. We saw in the Madeira high, gently sloping
banks, covered with verdant grass and neat trees and
palms along the top of them; whereas along the
Amazon the trees stood almost in the water on the
recently formed islands and banks. The left bank of
the Madeira was of grey and reddish clay (grey below,
red above), cut vertically, sometimes actually in steps.
Blocks of a rectangular shape, in getting dried up,
split and fell over, leaving the banks vertical. The
right bank, on the contrary, was gently sloping,
descending with a beautiful carpet of green grass
into the stream. The islands were charming, with
lovely lawns all round. Blackish and deep red rock,
vertical and fluted, and with innumerable perforations,
could be seen here and there, covered over with a
padding of earth from ten to twenty feet deep.</p>

<p>The journey up the Madeira River had no great
interest. By seven o'clock in the evening we arrived
at the mouth of the Canuma River&mdash;or rather at a
channel connecting the Madeira River with the river
Canuma, which river actually has its proper mouth
about half-way between Itaquatiara and Santarem,
at a place called Parintins. By way of the connecting
channel the two rivers were only a short
distance apart, but that channel was not always
navigable. The steam launch, which drew little water,
would have difficulty in going through, even at that
time, when the water was fairly high.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Street of Tarma.</p>
<hr />
<p>We therefore thought we would stay for the night
at the mouth of the channel, and start on our journey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-413" id="Pg_2-413"></a>[<a href="./images/2-413.png">413</a>]</span>
by that difficult passage in broad daylight the next
day. There was a house on the right-hand side of
the mouth of the channel. While we made preparations
to make ourselves comfortable for the night
on the launch, the pilot went up to the house in order
to get an expert at that place to take us through the
dangerous channel.</p>

<p>I was just in the middle of my dinner when the
pilot sent down a message for me to go up to the
house at once, as my presence was required immediately.
I struggled up the steep incline, not knowing
what was up. Much to my amazement, on reaching
the house, I saw before me my man Filippe the negro,
who rushed at me and embraced me tenderly, and the
other man I had left with him in charge of the baggage.
The two men had been picked up by a boat two days
up the river Canuma, where I had left them with my
baggage, and they had come down expecting to meet
me in Manaos. They had got stranded at that place,
and although they had hailed one or two steamers
which had gone down the river, no one had paid any
attention to them, and there they had remained.</p>

<p>"Have you saved the photographs and the baggage,
Filippe?" I immediately asked, when I had made
certain that both men were in good condition.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Filippe. "I have everything with
me. I have taken the greatest care of everything."</p>

<p>That was for me a happy moment, after all the
vicissitudes we had had of late. The most important
part of my baggage was saved. I had taken all my
men back alive&mdash;if perhaps not very much alive&mdash;after
so fateful an expedition. I felt happy beyond words.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-414" id="Pg_2-414"></a>[<a href="./images/2-414.png">414</a>]</span>
The man who owned the house was the trader who
had taken Filippe and the other man down the river
in his boat, so I gave him a present of money and also
a lot of provisions which I had on board and which
we should not now need any more, as we should return
at once to Manaos.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-414.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-414_th.jpg" alt="The Market Place, Tarma." title="The Market Place, Tarma." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">The Market Place, Tarma.</p>
<hr />
<p>Next morning, all as happy as possible, we steamed
down full speed on our way back to Manaos. We came
in for dirty weather all the time, which obliged us to
halt for several hours and put into Itaquatiara for
shelter. A few hours later we were once more in the
capital of the Amazonas, in the city of jewellers'
shops and filthy food. On landing I found Maxim
guns and artillery on one side of the principal square,
with police troops in charge of them ready to fire;
while on the other side were the Federal troops, also
with their artillery ready for battle. It was with
some concern that I found myself obliged to pass
between those warlike bodies in order to enter the hotel.
I was not so anxious for myself as I was for my photographic
negatives and note-books, after I had taken
all that trouble to save them.</p>

<p>However, the Governor at the last moment became
scared, and went personally to call on the Commandante
of the Federal troops in order to assure him of his
friendship and affection, so that after all no battle
took place that day.</p>

<p>Only a short time previously the flotilla had bombarded
the town. The people of Manaos had got so
accustomed to those little excitements that they
thought nothing of them. There were occasionally a
few people killed, but that was all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-415" id="Pg_2-415"></a>[<a href="./images/2-415.png">415</a>]</span>
It will be remembered that the <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i> of Filippe
the negro was to buy himself a <i>mallettinha</i> (a little
trunk). The first thing he had asked me after I had
rescued him was if I had seen any good <i>mallettinhas</i>
in Manaos. So after landing we at once proceeded
to buy a tin <i>mallettinha</i> with a strong lock. Then I
paid him off and gave him an ample reward, as he
had been the pluckiest and most faithful of all my
men. He was certainly the man who had given me the
least trouble of the entire lot.</p>

<p>Filippe had tears in his eyes when he received his
pay and present. He embraced me and thanked me
a million times for having made him a rich man.</p>

<p>"After all," said he, "we have suffered a great
deal, but now I shall be happy for ever. I shall marry
the girl who is waiting for me at home."</p>

<p>"If ever I come out on another journey, Filippe,
will you go with me again?" I asked him.</p>

<p>Filippe pondered for a moment. "Yes," he said
with determination. "I have proved to you that I
am afraid of nothing. You only have to order me,
and I will go with you. Even if we are to suffer again
as we have suffered on this journey!"</p>

<p>Filippe was a good fellow.</p>

<p>The other man when paid off received his money
and his reward silently. He went out into the street,
and returned four hours later without one single
penny. He had purchased an expensive suit of
clothes, a number of silk neckties, a gold chain,
watch, etc.</p>

<p>The next morning there was a steamer sailing for
Rio de Janeiro, so I packed off the jubilant Filippe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-416" id="Pg_2-416"></a>[<a href="./images/2-416.png">416</a>]</span>
paying a second-class passage for him on the steamer
and a first-class on the railway, as I had done for the
other men, with wages up to the day of his arrival in
Araguary, his native town.</p>

<p>Thus I saw the last of that plucky man&mdash;the only
one who had remained of the six who had originally
started with me.</p>

<p>On December 16th I left Manaos for good on my
way to Peru, escorted to the good Booth Line steamer
<i>Atahualpa</i> by the Commandante of the Federal troops,
the representatives of the Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Commercial, Dr.
Maso, and some of my English and American friends.</p>

<p>It was with the greatest delight that I saw Manaos
vanish away from sight as we descended the Rio
Negro. Rounding the point at its mouth, steaming
towards the west, we entered the Solem&otilde;es River. This
river is navigable by fairly good-sized boats as far as
Iquitos, in the province of Loreto in Peru.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Highest Point where Author crossed the Andes before reaching the Railway at Oroya.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was badly in need of rest, and expected to get
it on those few days of navigation up the river, having
dreamt of how I could lie on deck and do nothing,
as that part was well known and there was no
work for me to do. But, indeed, on that journey
none of my dreams were realized, for, worse luck,
the steamer, which had only accommodation for ten,
carried not less than seventy or eighty passengers,
fifty of them forming part of a Spanish theatrical
company which was on its way to Iquitos. The deck
of the ship had been turned into a kind of theatre,
where rehearsals went on day and night. When the
rehearsals were not going on, the men and women,
following the usual habits of theatrical people, sang<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-417" id="Pg_2-417"></a>[<a href="./images/2-417.png">417</a>]</span>
and practised flights of notes&mdash;which was a little trying
after the dead silence of the forest.</p>

<p>However, thanks to the great civility of the managers
of the Booth Line at Manaos, and to the extreme
thoughtfulness of the captain of the <i>Atahualpa</i>, I
was made quite comfortable in the chart-room of the
ship, which was as far away as possible from the noise.
We were most of the time in mid-stream. The
river was so wide that we could not see anything
on either side. We steamed up day after day, occasionally
passing islands of some beauty rising above
the muddy waters of the Solim&otilde;es. Navigation of
that river was difficult, as the navigable channels were
constantly changing, islands disappearing and new
islands forming all the time. Elich Island, in the Timbuctuba
group, was fast disappearing, while another
island was forming just below it.</p>

<p>We passed the mouth of the Putumayo River at
sunset one day, a most wonderful effect of clouds being
produced over a brilliant cadmium yellow and vermilion
sky, shining with great brightness above the
dark green trees upon a high reddish cliff.</p>

<p>In a drenching morning at five o'clock we reached
Esperan&ccedil;a, the Brazilian frontier post, which consisted
of half a dozen one-storied houses with red-tiled roofs,
situated on a grassy expanse. Grassy hills of no
great height rose at the mouth of the Javari River, a
southern tributary of the Solim&otilde;es River, forming
there the boundary between Brazil and Peru. Dark
green foliage perched high up on asparagus-like stems
of trees formed a background to that wretchedly
miserable place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-418" id="Pg_2-418"></a>[<a href="./images/2-418.png">418</a>]</span>
Tabatinga, on the left side of the stream, was the
Brazilian military post on the frontier. A neatly-built,
loopholed, square blockhouse, painted white,
was situated some fifty feet above the level of the
river on the summit of the bank. It was reached by
a long flight of white cement steps. The Brazilian
flag flew gaily upon a flagstaff at this most westerly
point of the great Brazilian Republic on the Amazon
(Solim&otilde;es) River.</p>

<p>A few soldiers dressed in khaki stood, with their legs
wide apart, watching the arrival of the steamer, while
their officers in speckless white clothes hastily descended
the long flight of steps and came on board, bringing
bouquets of flowers to the captain.</p>

<p>There was a pretty garden near the blockhouse.
Three mountain guns pointed viciously at the river
from the most exposed position in Tabatinga at the
top of the staircase. According to the account of a
non-commissioned officer, there was a force there of
240 soldiers "<i>escondido no matto</i>"&mdash;that is to say,
kept hidden in the forest!</p>

<p>After we had passed the frontier on the north side
of the river, a tiny tributary brook, almost hidden by
the vegetation and only identified by a white-barked
tree on the left bank and huts on either side, the
scenery made a change for the better.</p>

<p>Leticia was the name of the Peruvian frontier
post, which consisted of two or three brick sheds with
corrugated iron roofs.</p>

<p>We arrived at Iquitos on December 23rd, at 8.30 a.m.,
having employed seven days and twenty hours on our
run from Manaos.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> change in the characteristics of the people the
moment you were in Peru was considerable, and
striking was the neatness of the buildings. Iquitos
was a pleasant little city, the streets of which needed
paving badly, but were otherwise well aligned and
tidy. There were numbers of foreigners there, including
a small English colony made up of employ&eacute;s
of the Booth Line and the representatives of a few
commercial houses. It is difficult to realize how
pleasant Englishmen can be when they live in those
out-of-the-way places.</p>

<p>After the Putumayo atrocities a proper English
Consulate, in charge of Mr. Mitchell, formerly our vice-consul
in Paris, had been established there. Yellow
fever was rampant at that time in Iquitos, and reaped
many victims daily.</p>

<p>Although Iquitos was 2,300 kil. farther up the river
than Manaos, the price of all commodities in that
country was less than half those in Manaos, and the
quality of the articles twice as good. That is what
comes of having free trade instead of a high tariff.</p>

<p>I spent a pleasant Christmas in Iquitos, all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-420" id="Pg_2-420"></a>[<a href="./images/2-420.png">420</a>]</span>
English residents there showing me the greatest kindness.
From Iquitos the river was no longer navigable
for ocean-going steamers, and it was necessary to
travel by small launches. There was no regular
service, but there were a number of trading launches
which went a certain distance up the river in order
to trade with the different houses on the banks of
the stream. The travelling was not particularly rapid,
as one stopped ten or twenty times a day, and wasted
endless time while the people came on board to buy
beer or rum, or cotton goods, looking-glasses, etc.,
etc. Rubber and aigrettes, as well as money, were
given in exchange for the goods received.</p>

<p>I left Iquitos on December 29th, on the launch
<i>Rimac</i>, belonging to the Swiss firm of Messikommer.
I was told that she would be ready to start at 9 a.m.
sharp on December 28th, and at that time I got on
board. The actual time of our departure was at 6.30
in the afternoon of December 29th. That was, of
course, Iquitos punctuality.</p>

<p>The Prefect of the Province of Loreto had shown
me much civility, and had telegraphed, by the wireless
installation which had been established between
Iquitos and Lima, making every possible arrangement
for me to travel quickly. Thus, although in a terrible
condition of health, I was able to make a record
journey between Iquitos and Lima, the capital of Peru.</p>

<p class="fsc">Oroya, the Highest Railway Station in the World.</p>
<hr />
<p>Once started in the launch <i>Rimac</i>, we went through
interesting channels, outlets of the main stream being
often noticeable on either bank, cutting wide passages
through the forest and forming one or more shallow
lakelets, with innumerable aquatic plants on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-421" id="Pg_2-421"></a>[<a href="./images/2-421.png">421</a>]</span>
surface of the water. As we went farther it became
easy to understand how islands were constantly
forming in the river. Quantities of large and small
logs of wood were continually floating down the stream;
the banks were gradually being eaten away by the
current. Whole trees fell down with their immense
branches and polypi-like roots, and formed a barrier
arresting the progress of the floating wood. Particles of
earth deposited by wind and by water saturated with
impurities settled there. Soon grass would begin to
grow on those deposits, which quickly collected more
deposits of flying and floating particles. The soft
bottom of the river, disturbed by the deviated current,
piled up mud against the submerged branches resting
on the river-bed. Quickly an island was then formed;
more wood accumulated, more grass, more mud;
the base of the islands would increase rapidly, and
in the space of a few years islands several kilometres
in length rose above the water.</p>

<p>We had reached a point where the two great rivers
Mara&ntilde;on and Ucayalli&mdash;both descending from the
Andes&mdash;joined and formed the river Solim&otilde;es, which
we had so far navigated. We followed the Ucayalli.</p>

<p>On December 31st we entered a small arm on the
left side of the river and we reached no less a place
than New York&mdash;very dissimilar, I can assure you,
from its namesake of the United States of North
America. Far from seeing skyscrapers, brilliantly
illuminated streets, and ferry-boats and steamers
galore, there were only half a dozen thatched huts
with <i>bona</i>-palm walls and floors. In the water floated
two or three small canoes; that was all. The place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-422" id="Pg_2-422"></a>[<a href="./images/2-422.png">422</a>]</span>
was chiefly remarkable for the number and the
fierceness of its mosquitoes&mdash;regular clouds of them.
Only one thing New York of Ucayalli seemed to have
in common with New York of the United States&mdash;the
people seemed to be able to stand a lot of drink.
They purchased from the <i>Rimac</i> a number of boxes
of beer.</p>

<p>We proceeded. In a way it was amusing to travel
on a trading boat. Every time we approached a hut
the steamer blew her whistle; the people got up,
at any time of the night, to come on board and see
what there was for sale. I slept on deck, and from
my bed could see what was going on all the time.</p>

<p>St. Helena came next, with its depot and farmhouse.
A few cows could be seen grazing on the
poorest kind of grass. We could often get good fruit
at those farmhouses, principally bananas, pineapples,
and <i>mam&atilde;o</i>. Then we stopped at Reque&ntilde;a, on the
left bank of the river, where a wireless telegraphic
station of the Telefunken system was established. It
was quite a nice little place, with a few houses, built
of unbaked clay and roofed with zinc.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Highest Point of the Oroya Railway: the Galera Tunnel.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was entertaining to watch the pride of the local
gentlemen when they showed me their houses&mdash;mere
sheds of the humblest description, but in their eyes
far superior to any palace of Europe. An imported
chair or an antiquated desk would supply them
with conversation to last hours. The wives of those
settlers were generally eccentric persons who looked
suspiciously at us. One of them at Reque&ntilde;a made
me feel most uncomfortable by the annoying way
in which she looked at my only shoe&mdash;as I was unable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-423" id="Pg_2-423"></a>[<a href="./images/2-423.png">423</a>]</span>
to put a shoe on the other much swollen foot. She
never took her eyes off that shoe, and stooped down
many times to examine it closer.</p>

<p>A short distance from Reque&ntilde;a, still on the left
side of the river, was the mouth of the Tapiche River,
a tributary of the Ucayalli. On the right bank of
this river was California, and then Avispa&mdash;a pretty
spot. Two new red-roofed houses with large verandas
stood prominent on a green grassy hill about 120 ft.
high, while on the ridge in continuation of the hill
itself could be seen a number of small houses, some
with zinc roofs, others with <i>bona</i> roofs and walls.</p>

<p>The Ucayalli was a rich stream. It was interesting
to notice how many trading launches were to be seen
on that river, and the amazing part of it was that they
could all exist. Hardly a day went by that we did
not meet two or three launches. We were also constantly
meeting canoes, generally hollowed out of
tree-trunks, and larger boats of a more solid construction.</p>

<p>The population was entirely composed of a mixture
of Spanish and Indian types and of pure Indians.
Some of the latter had Mongolian characteristics;
others were more of the Malay and Papuan types.</p>

<p>After the first day or two the voyage on the launch
was tedious. One got tired of the endless conversation
and of listening to the bargaining. The perpetual
drinking which had to be witnessed was of little interest
to a teetotaller. One seldom saw money change
hands, all being done by barter, the merchandise we
had on board being exchanged chiefly for rubber.
Even so far up the river civilization had well set in,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-424" id="Pg_2-424"></a>[<a href="./images/2-424.png">424</a>]</span>
and great caution was needed in buying balls of rubber.
It was advisable to split them in two before purchase,
as they generally contained all kinds of rubbish instead
of pure coagulated latex.</p>

<p>After Brazil, however, the villages and houses of
Peru looked clean and neat.</p>

<p>The prices of food were somewhat high, chickens
fetching 4<i>s.</i> each, whereas in Iquitos they fetched
from 8<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>; eggs sold for 6<i>d.</i> each, and were
generally bad, the good ones being eaten by the people
themselves.</p>

<p>We went up the Tapiche River, a tributary on the
right bank, and visited the estate newly bought by
an American company. In fact, we were there at
midnight of December 31st, and drank in the New
Year with Mr. Anzelius, the director, and his Polish
and Italian assistants.</p>

<p>On January 2nd, 1912, we saw a great many Indians
along the banks of the river, who ran away when they
saw the camera pointed at them.</p>

<p>The people on that river were fond of giving high-sounding
names to their houses. We passed a place
called Philadelphia, where a large farm with lean
cattle, ducks and fowls, could be seen, looking as
miserable as possible; also plenty of banana palms
and sugar-cane.</p>

<p>Some way off, after passing the large saw-mills
of Cumaseba and Tamanco, where an interesting
collection of animals and Indian weapons had been
made by the proprietor, we came in the evening to
the farm of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p class="fsc">Beautiful Scenery on the Peruvian Corporation Railway to Cuzco, Peru.</p>
<hr />
<p>Early on January 3rd we passed San Roque, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-425" id="Pg_2-425"></a>[<a href="./images/2-425.png">425</a>]</span>
then Condorcanqui, a fine plantation of bananas along
the river bank, and also a plantation of <i>yuta</i> (jute) and
some bread trees. Clouds of aigrette storks could be seen
in the evening circling about, thousands and thousands
of them. They produced a most curious effect in the
distance against the heavy black clouds of the sky.</p>

<p>We entered the Yanna Yakka stream, the water
of which was almost absolutely stagnant and as black
as ink, full of snakes, fish, and crocodiles. Yanna
Yakka in the local Indian language means "black
water." We steamed for two hours up that river as
far as Porto Central, the river being quite narrow&mdash;only
150 m. wide. We eventually arrived at the
prettiest spot I had so far seen on the river, called
Porto Principal. On an elongated island not more
than 80 m. wide were to be seen four large buildings
of <i>bona</i> palm, with spacious verandas and corrugated
iron roofs. The buildings were connected by high
bridges. All those structures were built on piles
12 ft. high. Many <i>chapaha</i> palms of great height
were to be seen there.</p>

<p>I heard at that place an extraordinary account of
how a dirigible balloon, with nobody on board, had
some few years before passed over the house. The
balloon&mdash;which my informant, in his ignorant language,
called a "huge square globe"&mdash;flew, according to
him, a flag, the stars and stripes, and had an anchor
dangling down. The balloon was travelling in a
westerly direction. It flew a little higher than the
trees, and caused a great scare among the natives.
My informant told me that there was no one in the
car at all, but they waved their hands at him (<i>sic</i>)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-426" id="Pg_2-426"></a>[<a href="./images/2-426.png">426</a>]</span>
when they passed over his house! He then told me
that the air-ship had passed in the daytime and
had quickly disappeared, but that it was beautifully
lighted with coloured lights at night. So that it
would be difficult from that truthful account to place
much reliance on what the man said or on what he
had seen at all. It is quite possible&mdash;after discarding
all the indisputable embroidery from the
story&mdash;that a balloon actually went over that place,
and it may probably have been Wellman's abandoned
balloon with which he had tried to go across the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>On January 3rd and 4th we had no great excitement.
We stopped at numberless places. Nearly all the
houses in that district were made in three sections,
the two end rooms enclosed in <i>bona</i>-palm walls, while
the central and larger room had two open sides. All
the houses were perched up on piles, owing to the
frequent inundations. Sewing-machines and gramophones
were to be found in nearly every house. All
the women wore, rather becomingly over such ugly
countenances, the valuable hats which generally go
under the name of "Panamas." The river was getting
beautiful as we went farther up, immense grassy
stretches being visible where the country was not
inundated, and low shrubs emerging from the water
in the many channels that were formed everywhere.</p>

<p class="fsc">A. B. Leguia, the President of the Peruvian Republic.</p>
<hr />
<p>On January 5th we arrived at Terra Blanca, where
a lakelet had been formed by an outlet of the river
on the left bank. A place called Pernambuco was
situated at the entrance of this lake. The water of
the lake was beautifully clear and of a wonderful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-427" id="Pg_2-427"></a>[<a href="./images/2-427.png">427</a>]</span>
greenish colour. Beautiful white and yellow sand
deposits were to be found around it. Five hundred
people lived at Pernambuco. The <i>Rimac</i> did a brisk
trade, over a hundred pounds sterling worth of goods
being sold in an hour at that place.</p>

<p>On January 6th I saw the first hills of importance
we had seen since leaving the lower Amazon. Those
were the hills of Petronilla, where a mass of volcanic
rocks and some interesting hot springs were to be
found. A ridge ran from south-east to north-west in
symmetrical undulations up to 1,000 ft. from Petronilla
to Cancha Huayo. It rose quite abruptly from
the flat alluvial land. Where a land-slide had occurred
it showed an upper stratum of grey alluvial deposit
10 ft. thick, with soft yellow volcanic rock underneath,
in a stratum of 30 ft. thick. It seemed as if that hill
had been lifted up by volcanic pressure from underneath,
as a lot of white and yellow sand had been
brought to the surface, which evidently formed a
substratum in the Ucayalli region.</p>

<p>We found strong whirlpools where the channel
of the river formed an elbow at the foot of the mountain.
The steam launch made poor progress against the
strong current.</p>

<p>On January 7th we arrived at the large settlement
of Condamano, a sub-Prefecture in the big province
of Loreto. There were two parallel streets, clean and
well kept, with others intersecting at right angles.
On the main street along the water front were many
large commercial houses, handsome buildings of <i>ca&ntilde;a</i>
walls and zinc roofs. The place had been built on a
flat high land about 30 ft. above the river, and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-428" id="Pg_2-428"></a>[<a href="./images/2-428.png">428</a>]</span>
some 1,500 to 2,000 inhabitants. One of the peculiarities
of Condamano was that during the rubber-collecting
season the population consisted almost
entirely of women, as the men were in the forest
collecting the latex.</p>

<p>We arrived there on a feast day&mdash;they have more
feast days than working days in the week in that
country&mdash;and the streets were alive with monks and
soldiers, the only men who do not go collecting rubber.
Women and girls, in flesh-coloured stockings and lace
mantillas, flocked out of the church, each carrying
a small carpet which they used to prevent spoiling
their finery when kneeling down.</p>

<p>On leaving Condamano we came to the north-westerly
end of the range we had seen the day before.
It ended abruptly in almost vertical walls of yellow
sandstone of various shades. The range was thickly
wooded on its summit. The opposite bank of the
river was absolutely flat.</p>

<p>That evening we came in for a heavy storm, which
compelled us to halt from 6 o'clock until 2.10 a.m.
Black clouds had accumulated overhead to the west.
A boisterous gust of wind suddenly caught us, which
swept off our chicken-coop, buckets, and other loose
things which were on the roof of the launch. We
were tossed about in a most alarming way, and were
just able to tie up under shelter and make fast to
some trees. The wind increased in fury, and the
launch tore up her moorings, bringing down a big
tree on the top of us with a tremendous crash.</p>

<hr />
<p>There was a stampede on board, as everybody
thought we had been struck by lightning. Some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-429" id="Pg_2-429"></a>[<a href="./images/2-429.png">429</a>]</span>
the people were just able to jump on shore, while
other Peruvians, men and women, scared to death
by the diabolic clashing of thunder and the vivid
lightning, knelt on the decks and prayed fervently
that we might escape unhurt.</p>

<p>I had a narrow escape, a lighted petroleum lamp
which swung above getting off its hook and falling
on my head, upsetting all the petroleum over me.
Fortunately it went out as it fell on me. In the
middle of the night we had a great deal of trouble to
make the boat fast once more, the waves in the river
being of great height. The rattle of all the merchandise
and broken crockery on board, the moans of the
scared Peruvians, with the howling of the wind, made
a regular pandemonium.</p>

<p>When we proceeded up the river next morning
we came upon more interesting islands in course of
formation. We saw quantities of <i>ca&ntilde;a baraba</i>, wild
cane, with its fan-disposed, elongated leaves. The
natives used the reeds for walling their houses. Being
absolutely straight, they are well adapted for that
purpose.</p>

<p>On January 9th we passed several villages. Along
the banks we saw many Indians, all dressed up
in bright costumes, principally red shawls. We entered
a tiny channel on the right bank and went as
far as a place called San Jeronimo, a fairly large
settlement. This small channel was, as late as 1895,
the main stream, which has since been diverted by
the formation of a low island. At sunset we perceived
to the west what appeared at first a mass of
low clouds revolving in a circle at a great speed. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-430" id="Pg_2-430"></a>[<a href="./images/2-430.png">430</a>]</span>
closer inspection we found it to be millions of <i>gar&ccedil;as</i>
or aigrette storks flying in a circle.</p>

<p>I arrived in the evening of January 10th at Masisea,
where another wireless telegraph station had been
established by the Peruvian Government. At this
place I left the launch <i>Rimac</i>, and found the Government
launch <i>Esploradora</i>, which had been detained there
by the Prefect of Loreto for two days, awaiting my
arrival. Having transhipped at once, I was able to
proceed on January 11th on the latter. She was to
take me as far as possible toward the foot of the Andes.</p>

<p>As we proceeded up the river we saw extensive
farms surrounded by clearings of good land, with lots
of cattle and horses, especially on the left bank of the
river. We purchased an ox, so as to have fresh meat
on board.</p>

<p>The small launch was, unfortunately, packed with
a great many Peruvian travellers. There were no
cabins, and one had to sleep on the roof of the launch.
Everybody was most civil, and with the new camp-bed
I had purchased in Manaos I was able to make
myself as comfortable as was possible under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Beautiful specimens of <i>cataua</i> trees of great height
were constantly to be seen in the forest along the
banks. The resin from these trees is extremely
poisonous, and is much used by the local Indians for
killing fish. We halted for five hours that day in
order to take on board sufficient wood for the engines
to last us the entire journey. At 6.30 that afternoon
we left the Ucayalli river and entered the tributary
Pachitea, on the left side, the Ucayalli describing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-431" id="Pg_2-431"></a>[<a href="./images/2-431.png">431</a>]</span>
big curve where the Pachitea enters it. Just before
reaching the mouth of the Pachitea, the Ucayalli
had first a big arm deviating from the main stream on
the left bank, then soon after another great arm also on
the left side. The navigation of those rivers was now
getting difficult, and we had to halt at night.</p>

<p>On January 12th we started up the Pachitea River,
a stream much smaller than the Ucayalli, but more
interesting. Soon after departing we could perceive
in the distance before us a high hill range. Crocodiles
and white storks were innumerable, while fallen trees
impeded navigation constantly. Once or twice we
banged with such force against immense floating
logs of wood that it made the launch quiver in a most
alarming way. In the dirty water of the stream it
was not always possible to detect the floating logs,
which sometimes were just under the surface of the
water. Immense quantities of <i>ca&ntilde;a baraba</i> were to
be seen on the banks, and great numbers of delicately-tinted
violet flowers which enlivened the landscape.
The <i>ca&ntilde;a</i> had light violet-coloured <i>panaches</i>, which
were much used by the Indians in the manufacture
of their arrows. The banks were of alluvial formation.
Islets of grey sand mixed with volcanic ashes could
be seen. The current was strong.</p>

<p>We saw large families of <i>ciancias</i>&mdash;beautiful birds
with velvety black bodies speckled with white, and
fan tails of rich brown colour, feathers of the same
colour being also on the outer half of the wings. They
possessed slender, most elegant necks, small brown-crested
heads, and light yellow chests. Seen at a
distance they were not, in shape, unlike pheasants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-432" id="Pg_2-432"></a>[<a href="./images/2-432.png">432</a>]</span>
Twenty or thirty together at a time could be seen
playing among the lower branches of the trees along
the edge of the river. Then there were small birds
of a beautiful metallic blue-black, with very long
tails; these latter were innumerable near the water.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Beautiful Example of Ancient Spanish Wood-carving, Peru.</p>
<hr />
<p>The rainy season was in full swing. In the morning
we generally had white mist rising among the trees,
while during the day rain was usually plentiful and
rendered travelling somewhat monotonous, as we could
not see much. We saw many specimens of the <i>tagua</i>
or <i>yarina</i>, a small palm, the leaves of which were
used in that region for roofing houses. At last we
came to the first rocks I had seen in the river since
leaving the Tapajoz River. They were at the double
whirlpool of Naittavo. At the island of Errera was a
narrow channel only 30 to 40 m. wide, where the current
was extremely strong, and just deep enough for our
launch, which drew 5 ft. of water. The upstream
end of the island was strewn with logs of wood,
forming a kind of barrage, the water of the dividing
stream being thrown with great force against it. It
was here that we got the first sight of high mountains&mdash;a
great change after the immense stretches of flat land
we had encountered all along the Amazon, Solim&otilde;es
and Ucayalli. I saw some beautiful specimens of
the idle or sleepy monkey, the <i>preguya</i>, a nocturnal
animal with wonderful fur. The small launch was
swung about with great force from one side to the
other by the strong current and whirlpools. We
saw a number of <i>Cashibos</i> (Carapaches and Callisecas)
on the right bank of the river. They are said to be
cannibals, but personally I rather doubt it. If they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-433" id="Pg_2-433"></a>[<a href="./images/2-433.png">433</a>]</span>
have occasionally eaten a missionary or two, I believe
that it must have been rather as a religious superstition
than because of the actual craving for human
flesh. Also it is possible that, as is the case with
many African tribes, the Cashibos may believe that
eating an enemy gives strength and courage, and
may have indulged in this practice purely on that
account. So that I do not think that it is fair to
call those Indians cannibals in the true sense of the
word, any more than it would be fair to call a teetotaller
a drunkard because he took a drink or two of brandy
for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>The word "Cashibo" in the Pana language means
vampire. Those Indians are great fighters, and are
in a constant state of hostility with all their neighbours.
They are good hunters and fishermen. Their weapons
are well made, and consist of bow and arrows, spears
and war-clubs. The Callisecas and Carapaches are
very light in colour, with a yellowish skin, not darker
than that of the average Spaniard. They are fine-looking
people, fairly hairy on the face and body.
The men grow long beards. Men and women generally
go about naked, but some of the Indians near the
river have adopted long shawls in which they wrap
themselves. After marriage the women wear a loin-cloth,
but nothing at all before marriage. The girls
when young are attractive, with luminous, expressive,
dark brown eyes. These Cashibos are supposed to
be the "white race" of the Amazon. They are nevertheless
not white at all, but belong to a yellow race,
although they are, as I have said, of a light yellow
colour. Many yellow races have come under my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-434" id="Pg_2-434"></a>[<a href="./images/2-434.png">434</a>]</span>
observation in the islands of the Pacific Ocean,
who were just as light as the Cashibos, such as
the Bilans and Manobos, and some who were even
whiter than they are, such as the Mansakas of the
Mindanao Island. The Cashibos are wild people, and
the settlers in the neighbourhood are much afraid of
them.</p>

<p>On January 13th, when we were three days out
from Masisea, we were travelling between high rocky
hills with almost vertical sides. Their section showed
in the lower portion narrow bands of violet-coloured
rock and white light stone in a horizontal stratum.
Above that had accumulated a deep layer from 30
to 100 ft. thick of red earth.</p>

<p>We went across a dangerous whirlpool. The
launch hardly had enough strength to pull through
at full speed. The water all around us formed great
circles with deep central hollows, and, as we went
through, rose before us like a wall. It had quite an
impressive effect. That particular whirlpool was
called Sheboya. Soon afterwards we obtained a
beautiful view of the high range&mdash;the Sira mountains.</p>

<p class="fsc">Wonderful Example of Old Spanish Wood-Carving, Peru.</p>
<hr />
<p>On January 14th we went over the whirlpool of
Marques, a most picturesque sight. On the banks
of the river was plenty of rubber, <i>hevea</i>, but not of
quite such good quality as that found in Brazil. Some
of the trees exuded white and some yellow latex,
the coloration being probably due to the quality of
the soil. There were few habitations along the banks
of the Pachitea River. There were tribes of the
Campas (or Antis) and Cashibos Indians, the members<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-435" id="Pg_2-435"></a>[<a href="./images/2-435.png">435</a>]</span>
of both races having marked Malay characteristics.
Occasionally one met extraordinary people in those
out-of-the-way regions. When we halted for wood,
which we used instead of coal for our engine, a man
some six feet four inches in height came on board&mdash;quite
an extraordinary-looking person. To my amazement,
when I spoke to him, he turned out to be a man
of refined taste and quite highly educated. He was
a Hungarian count and an officer in the Austrian army,
who, having got into trouble in his own country, had
gone to settle there.</p>

<p>From a place called Cahaubanas, at the confluence
of the river Pichis with the Pachitea, it was possible
to cross over on foot to the Mayro, a stream which
flowed into the Palcazu, and in two more days' walking
(about 75 kil.), the German colony of Potzuzu could
be reached at the meeting-place of the Potzuzu River
with the Uancabamba. From the German colony
158 kil. more would bring you to Uanuco, and 138
kil. farther on was Serra de Pasco, whence the railway
went to Lima.</p>

<p>Another trail from Cahaubanas proceeded to
Chuchura, about 50 kil. higher up the Mayro river.
From there it was possible to cross the Yanachag
Mountains and reach the settlement of Uancabamba.
The distance from Cahaubanas to Chuchura was one
and a half day's walking&mdash;some 40 kil. of heavy
climbing, that from Chuchura to Uancabamba two
days' marching. From Uancabamba one was able to
get mules in order to go over the high pass of Culebra
Marca and reach Serra de Pasco.</p>

<p>It was possible by that trail to reach Lima in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-436" id="Pg_2-436"></a>[<a href="./images/2-436.png">436</a>]</span>
few days on foot. It was out of the question for
me to attempt such a journey, the attack of beri-beri
in my right leg making it almost impossible for me
to stand up. I decided to go as far up the stream
as I could on the launch and by canoe.</p>

<p>At Cahaubanas were a monastery and a great
many Indians. After halting for the night at that
place we continued our journey up the Pachitea with
a strange medley of passengers on board. We had
the Hungarian count, an Italian farmer, who was a
remarkable musician and played the accordion beautifully;
we had some Peruvians, a Spanish emigrant, a
small Indian boy aged ten who acted as steward, and a
young fellow of German origin.</p>

<p>The cook on the launch was a lunatic, who was
under the impression that he was the Saviour. It
was too pathetic, and occasionally quite alarming, to
see the poor man leaving the cooking stove whenever
we passed any Indians on the banks, when he raised
his arms up in the air and, stretching them forward,
gave his benediction to the people he saw, instead of
looking after the boiling rice. His benedictions cost
him frequent kicks and shakings by the neck on the
part of the captain of the launch. He was absorbed
in fervent praying during the night. He seldom
condescended to speak to any of us on board, as he
said that he was not living on this earth, but would
come back some day to bring peace and happiness
to the whole world. Words of that kind were uttered
whilst he was holding a saucepan in one hand and
a ladle in the other. It was pathetic.</p>

<hr />
<p>In pouring rain we left again on January 16th<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-437" id="Pg_2-437"></a>[<a href="./images/2-437.png">437</a>]</span>
between the high rocky banks of the river, well padded
with earth and with dense vegetation. Extensive
beaches of grey sand and coarse gravel were passed,
until we arrived at Port Bermudez, situated at the
confluence of the Pichis with the Chibbis, a tributary
on the left bank. Here we found the last of the
chain of wireless stations which had three iron towers.
From that place a telephone and telegraph wire
have been installed right over the Andes and down to
Lima.</p>

<p>The passage on the Government launch from Masisea
to Bermudez cost &pound;7 10<i>s.</i> I heard there that, thanks
to the arrangements which had been made by the
Prefect of the Loreto Province, the number of mules
I required in order to cross the Andes was duly
waiting for me at the foot of that great chain of
mountains.</p>

<p>I therefore lost no time, and on January 17th,
having left the launch <i>Esploradora</i>, proceeded in a
canoe with all my baggage intending to navigate as
far as possible the river Pichis, a tributary of the
Pachitea, formed by the united Nazaratec and Asupizu
rivers.</p>

<p>The landscape was getting very beautiful, the
Sungaro Paro Mountains rising to a great height on
the south-west. Immense <i>lubuna</i> trees, not unlike
pines in shape, were the largest trees in that region&mdash;from
5 to 6 ft. in diameter. The current was so strong
that we were unable to reach the spot where the mules
were awaiting me, and I had to spend the night on
a gravel beach.</p>

<p>The next morning, however, January 18th, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-438" id="Pg_2-438"></a>[<a href="./images/2-438.png">438</a>]</span>
passing two small rapids, where my men had to go
into the water in order to pull the canoe through,
I arrived at Yessup, where my mules were awaiting
me, and where there was a <i>tambo</i> or rest-house, kept
beautifully clean.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Across the Andes&mdash;The End of the Trans-continental Journey</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> fortunate in obtaining some excellent Peruvian
muleteers to accompany me on the expedition over
the Andes. The trip might have been a rough one for
the ordinary traveller, but for me it was a real holiday
excursion, after the horrible time I had experienced in
Brazil. This notwithstanding the disagreeable weather
I encountered during the fourteen days' rough riding
which I employed in reaching the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>I started at once with my pack animals on the
trail which has been cut by the Peruvian Government
over the mountains. Rain came down in torrents.
Most of the country was swampy, the mules sinking
chest-deep in mud. The travelling was not exactly
what you would call pleasant. Your legs dangled
all the time in water and slush. As that trail was
used by caravans, the mules had cut regular transverse
grooves in the ground all along, in which successively
they all placed their hoofs. Each groove was filled
with slushy water, and was separated from the next
by a mud wall from one to three feet high. The
mules were constantly stumbling and falling. After
you had travelled a short distance you were in a
filthy condition, the torrential rain washing down the
splashes of mud and spreading them all over you.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-440" id="Pg_2-440"></a>[<a href="./images/2-440.png">440</a>]</span>
After leaving Yessup we crossed first the Sinchhuaqui
river, then the Aguachini. We began to
ascend two kilometres after we had left Yessup, and
marched steadily the entire day among gigantic
<i>aguaso</i> trees and wonderful ferns of great height,
until we reached the Miriatiriami <i>tambo</i>, 27 kil. from
Yessup.</p>

<p>On January 19th we followed the River Azupizu
along a narrow trail from 300 to 400 ft. above the
level of the river, with an almost vertical drop by the
side of us. Huge palms and ferns of indescribable
beauty were to be seen all along, while waterfalls
and streamlets constantly crossed the trail.</p>

<p>We encountered that day deep mud all the way,
the mules sinking up to their bellies in the slush.
The trail along the mountain side was cut in the soft
earth, and actually formed a deep groove only about
two feet wide, the mud and slush being held by the
solid transverse barriers which succeeded one another
at short intervals.</p>

<p class="fsc">Cuzco.</p>
<p class="figcenter">Llamas in foreground.</p>
<hr />
<p>At Piriatingalini and Puchalini we found light
cable suspension bridges, very shaky, which swung
to and fro as you rode over them. Most of them
were not more than four feet wide and had no
parapet at all. I cannot say that I felt particularly
happy when my mule&mdash;sure-footed, I grant&mdash;took me
across, the bridge swinging, quivering, and squeaking
with our weight on it, especially when we were in the
middle. The rivers were extremely picturesque, with
high mountains on either side, among which they
wound their way in a snake-like fashion over a rocky
bed, forming a series of cascades. We went that day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-441" id="Pg_2-441"></a>[<a href="./images/2-441.png">441</a>]</span>
25 kil., and arrived at the <i>tambo</i> of Azupizu, which
was in charge of a deserter from the French navy.
He was an extraordinary character. He had forgotten
French, and had neither learnt Spanish nor
the local language of the Campas Indians.</p>

<p>A tribe of those Indians was to be found near
there&mdash;very handsome people, the men solidly built
and muscular, with intelligent but brutal faces, with
the yellowish-brown skin and slanting eyes of the
Malay races. The eyes showed a great discoloration
in the upper part of the iris. They possessed straight
hair, slightly inclined to curl at the end. The nose
was flattened at the root. They wore a few ornaments
of feathers on the head. Their clothing consisted of
a loose gown not unlike a Roman toga. The women
were good-looking when very young.</p>

<p>The Campas claimed to be the direct descendants
of the Incas. There is no doubt that the Campas
were practically the same tribe as the Antis, once a
most powerful tribe which inhabited an extensive
territory to the north and east of Cuzco. In fact,
the eastern portion of the Inca country was once
called Anti-Suya. The Campas, or Antis, were
formerly ferocious. They are now quite tame, but
still retain their cruel countenances, resembling closely
those of Polynesians and Malays.</p>

<p>We left that place on January 20th in drenching
rain. The river was much swollen, and formed a
whirlpool of great magnitude just over some bad
rapids. We crossed from mountain-side to mountain-side,
some 400 ft. above the stream, in a sling car
running along a wire rope. The car consisted of two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-442" id="Pg_2-442"></a>[<a href="./images/2-442.png">442</a>]</span>
planks suspended on four pieces of telegraph wire.
As the sling had been badly constructed it did not
run smoothly along the cable. I had an unpleasant
experience&mdash;everybody had who used that conveyance&mdash;as
I was going across from one side to the other
of the stream, a distance of some 200 metres or more.
The ropes which were used for pulling the car along
got badly entangled when I had reached the middle
of the passage. The Indians and the Frenchman
pulled with violent jerks in order to disentangle them,
and caused the car to swing and bump to such an
extent that it was all I could do to hold on and not
be flung out of it. Having been swung to and fro
for the best part of an hour on that primitive arrangement,
I was able to proceed on the other side of the
stream. Fortunately we had taken the precaution of
making the animals cross over the river the previous
evening, before it was in flood, or else we should have
been held up there for several days. Leaving the
Azupizu river, we followed the river Kintoliani, which
joined the Azupizu and formed with it a most formidable
stream.</p>

<p class="fsc">A Famous Inca Wall, Cuzco.</p>
<p class="figcenter">The various rocks fit so perfectly that no mortar was used to keep them in place.</p>
<hr />
<p>The trail was at a great height, some 600 ft. above
the water. In two or three places where it had been
cut into the rock it was most dangerous, as the rocks
were slippery with the wet, so that the mules had
great difficulty in keeping their feet. The vegetation
was wonderful, with trees of enormous height and
beautiful giant palms. Waterfalls over rocky walls
were plentiful, while the effects of clouds were marvellous
among those mountains&mdash;although my enthusiasm
was damped a good deal that day by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-443" id="Pg_2-443"></a>[<a href="./images/2-443.png">443</a>]</span>
torrential rain, which came down in bucketfuls upon
us, and filtered through even my heavy waterproof
coat.</p>

<p>The zigzag ascent was extremely heavy, the first
part being over rocky ground, while the rest of that
day's journey was along a swampy trail on which
the mules stumbled and fell many times. One of
my men had a narrow escape from being precipitated
down the chasm. So bad, indeed, was the trail that
we only went 15 kil., halting at the <i>tambo</i> of Pampas
S. Nicolas.</p>

<p>On January 21st we made a long and tedious
march, rising all the time among slippery rocks along
precipices, or sinking in swampy mud on the narrow
trail. Picturesque waterfalls of great height were
visible in volcanic vents, some square, others crescent-shaped,
on the face of the mountain. The torrents,
swollen by the heavy rains, were difficult to cross, my
mules on several occasions being nearly swept away
by the foaming current. We sank in deep red slush
and in deep holes filled with water, but continued all
the time to ascend a gentle but continuous incline.
We travelled that day from six o'clock in the morning
until six o'clock in the evening, rain pouring down
upon us all the time. We were simply smothered in
mud from head to foot.</p>

<p>We found a large <i>tambo</i> at Camp 93, with a telephone
and telegraph station. At those <i>tambos</i> it was
always possible to obtain rice, chickens and eggs at
reasonable prices, fixed by the Government. In many
of the <i>tambos</i> were also rough wooden bedsteads, with
a more or less comfortable mattress. I generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-444" id="Pg_2-444"></a>[<a href="./images/2-444.png">444</a>]</span>
preferred to use my own camp-bed. As there were
never more than one or two rooms in the <i>tambo</i>, you
had to sleep in the same room with other people,
unless you preferred to sleep outside, as I did.</p>

<p>For the privilege of sleeping at any <i>tambo</i>, in or
out of doors, one paid the small sum of one shilling.
A dinner or lunch seldom cost more than two shillings,
and breakfast eightpence to one shilling. The food
for the animals could be reckoned at one shilling for
each mule, the price being higher at the Yessup end
of the journey and getting gradually lower as one
got nearer the capital.</p>

<p>Of course one could not call travelling over the
Andes in any way luxurious. The tablecloths at the
<i>tambos</i> showed all round the table the marks of
the dirty lips of previous travellers, and plentiful stains
of soup, coffee and tea. The illumination consisted
usually of a candle placed in the mouth of a bottle,
which was used as a candlestick.</p>

<p>I saw more Campas Indians there. They were
singing songs strongly resembling Malay melodies,
to the accompaniment of Spanish guitars. Other
songs influenced by Spanish airs, but still delivered
in a typically Malay fashion, were also given that
evening. They interested me greatly.</p>

<p class="fsc">Inca Three-Walled Fortress of Sacsayhuaman, Cuzco.</p>
<hr />
<p>On January 22nd we left Camp 93. I was struck
everywhere at those <i>tambos</i> by the great honesty of
the Peruvians. I was often touched by the extreme
kindness of the people and their considerate manner&mdash;although
perhaps it was more particularly striking
to me after my experience of the brutal behaviour
of the lower-class Brazilians. The gentle way of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-445" id="Pg_2-445"></a>[<a href="./images/2-445.png">445</a>]</span>
speaking, the more harmonious language&mdash;Spanish
instead of Portuguese&mdash;and the charming civility of
the people, made travelling, even under those unpleasant
circumstances, quite agreeable.</p>

<p>It was cold, especially at night. Nearly all my
instruments had been badly damaged in our many
accidents in Brazil, and I was unable to replace them
either in Par&aacute; or Manaos. Owing, therefore, to the
lack of self-registering thermometers, I could not
keep an accurate daily record of the maximum and
minimum temperatures. After leaving Camp 93, we
went over a really fearful trail, my mules being all
the time chest-deep in mud. It was extremely hard
work for the animals to get along. As is well known
to any traveller, all animals of a caravan when on a
narrow path step in the footprints of their predecessors,
so that on that trail they had sunk a long series of
deep holes in the soft clay, which were constantly
being filled by water sliding from the mountain-side.
In that particular part the mud had highly
caustic qualities, which burnt the skin and caused
irritation each time you were splashed. The muleteers
who were walking had their feet badly burnt by it,
one man suffering agony from his blistered feet.</p>

<p>Magnificent mountain scenery covered with luxuriant
forest surrounded us as the trail wound its
way along the high point on the top of the mountain
range. We went only 21 kil. that day from Pampas,
having occupied seven hours to cover the distance,
owing to the difficulties of the march.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we were enveloped in dense fog
which lasted the whole night, the cold being quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-446" id="Pg_2-446"></a>[<a href="./images/2-446.png">446</a>]</span>
severe, and the more perceptible because of the
humidity in the air. The trail here described a wide
detour, which could have easily been avoided had
another trail that went direct to New Bermudez been
followed at the bottom of the valley. The journey
by that lower trail could be accomplished in one day
and a half. The elevation by hypsometrical apparatus
of this camp (N.71) was 5,663 ft.</p>

<p>On January 23rd we descended rapidly through
beautiful forest from Camp 71, where we had halted
for the night, to a large <i>tambo</i> called Ene&ntilde;as, in charge
of an Italian. The place was situated in a beautiful
valley intersected by a streamlet saturated with lime.
It looked exactly like milk, and hurt your gums
considerably when you drank it. The excellent
mule I was riding had unfortunately hurt one of its
legs while we were crossing a swollen torrent, where
the mule and myself were nearly swept away in the
foaming current. Riding on the lame animal, which
was all the time stumbling and falling down on its
knees, was unpleasant. In the narrow trail it was
not possible to unload another animal and change
the saddle, and it was out of the question for me to
walk.</p>

<p class="fsc">Inca Doorway, Cuzco.</p>
<hr />
<p>I arrived at the <i>tambo</i> with a ravenous appetite,
but unfortunately nobody had telephoned from the
previous <i>tambo</i> that I was coming, so that it was
impossible to get lunch, and I had to wait two or
three hours before I could get anything to eat at all.
The men in charge of the various <i>tambos</i> were rather
negligent in telephoning and making arrangements
with the next <i>tambo</i>, as the kind of travellers they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-447" id="Pg_2-447"></a>[<a href="./images/2-447.png">447</a>]</span>
had on that trail was not of the highest type and
could not always be relied upon for payment. The
people in charge of the <i>tambos</i> were poor devils, half
<i>abrutis</i>, to use a most appropriate French expression,
by the life they had to lead in that forlorn country.</p>

<p>On January 24th we continued our journey over
horrible deep mud-holes, which made the trail extremely
dangerous. On that particular day we were
travelling over sticky soil, so that when the mules
trod in the deep holes they stuck with their hoofs
and fell over, immediately struggling wildly to free
themselves. One of my men was nearly thrown
down a precipice that day, and all of us, as well as
all the pack animals, had many unpleasant falls during
that march. Swampy places like that were encountered
for hundreds of metres at a time. In one place
that day we had two kilometres of continuous swampy
mud. In the afternoon I had a nasty fall, the mule
rolling right on the top of me and nearly breaking my
right leg. The animal in falling had sunk its head
in the sticky mud, and was struggling madly to release
itself. The animals were then marching chest-deep
in mud. In my helpless condition I tried to get off
when the animal fell, but sank up to my waist and
stuck fast with my legs in the mud. When the mule
rolled over, it knocked me down on the edge of the
precipice, my leg remaining caught under the animal.
Had not one of my muleteers been by my side at
the moment and rushed to my rescue, I should have
fared badly indeed.</p>

<p>We had a slippery descent after Tambo 33, where
we had a lunch composed of putrid tinned salmon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-448" id="Pg_2-448"></a>[<a href="./images/2-448.png">448</a>]</span>
and "invisible" eggs&mdash;the latter dish being a speciality
of that place. The <i>tambo</i> man insisted that I had eaten
six eggs, whereas I had not even seen them except
on the bill. He told me that I was wrong, showing me
a napkin on which two yellow streaks were to be seen&mdash;though
not left there by me, but by the lips of some
traveller who had passed perhaps a month before.</p>

<p>We made a long march that day, having left at
seven o'clock in the morning, and arriving at our
halting-place at four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The next day, January 25th, we had a trying
march. Several land-slides had taken place, bringing
down great patches of forest. Numberless trees had
fallen over, making it difficult for the animals to be
taken across. In one place all of them had to be
unloaded, and they sank so deeply in the slush and
soft earth that we had three or four hours' extremely
hard work to cover a distance of about 50 m. The
animals became so scared that they would not go on
at all. The men who pushed and led them along
that dangerous passage with a deep precipice on one
side were in constant danger.</p>

<p>The rain, which had been torrential during the
night, continued during the entire day, swelling the
streams and making them most difficult to cross.
In one stream my mule and I were swept away
altogether. I had water right up to my waist while
riding, and the mule showed only its head above
the water. We were thrown with great force against
some rocks, where, fortunately, my muleteers came to
our help and got us out again.</p>

<p class="fsc">Inca Steps carved in a Dome of Rock, Cuzco.</p>
<p class="figcenter">Fortress noticeable in the distance.</p>
<hr />
<p>The trail&mdash;about half a metre wide&mdash;wound its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-449" id="Pg_2-449"></a>[<a href="./images/2-449.png">449</a>]</span>
way up to a great height above the foaming river.
There were beautiful ferns of immense height, some
of which had finely ribbed, gigantic leaves. Graceful
yellow flowers, or sometimes beautiful red ones, were
to be seen on tall trees with white, clean stems.
We passed a coffee plantation, owned by English people,
near a charming settlement of whitewashed houses
on the opposite side of the river. When we came
to cross the Rio Las Palmas&mdash;heavily swollen&mdash;we
were once more nearly swept away in riding across
with water up to our chests. The baggage naturally
suffered a good deal in those constant immersions.
This was, unfortunately, the wrong season for crossing
the Andes; but I could not help that, as I was anxious
to get through, and could not wait for the fine weather
to come.</p>

<p>Farther on we crossed the river Paucartambo
near the Pueblo Pardo. We next followed the Rio
Chanchamayo, which afterwards became the Rio
Perene, along which extensive English farms had been
established. We were now getting near to civilization.
I felt that my work was entirely finished, as the
country hereabouts was well known.</p>

<p>We came to the Colorado river, a tributary of
the Chanchamayo, and passed S. Luiz de Shuaro, a
charming little village of whitewashed houses. The
scenery was beautiful on nearing La Merced. The
river basin showed luxuriant grassy slopes and immense
sugar plantations.</p>

<p>La Merced was situated on the left bank of the
Rio Chanchamayo, formed by the meeting of the Rio
Tulumayo and the Rio Tarma, which joined near the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-450" id="Pg_2-450"></a>[<a href="./images/2-450.png">450</a>]</span>
village of S. Ramon. It had two modest hotels and
various commercial houses. In a way I was sorry
to get to a town again, because in those places you
had all the trumpery illusion of civilization without
any of its real advantages. One met, however, with
the greatest civility from everybody, and, indeed,
with the greatest honesty. So that travelling in
those regions was quite a pleasure.</p>

<p>To my amazement that evening a burly Italian
came into the hotel. Who was he?&mdash;Garibaldi's
grandson, the son of General Canzio and Garibaldi's
daughter. He was interested in some mines in the
district, and had lived there for some years trying
to make a fortune.</p>

<p>What impressed one most in the settlements on
the Andes were the great neatness and cleanliness of
all the buildings, and the charming manners of all
the people one met. Everybody, without exception,
saluted you politely as you approached; everybody
was anxious to be of assistance or offer you hospitality.
There was, nevertheless, nothing of great interest in
those high-placed villages.</p>

<p>On January 26th I went on in a drenching rain,
having changed my animals at that place for another
lot of excellent mules. The hire of animals was somewhat
high, but after the prices one had to pay in
Brazil, everything seemed, by comparison, dirt-cheap
in Peru. I also said good-bye to the Peruvians who
had accompanied me so far, and employed Indians
to take charge of my animals.</p>

<p>From La Merced there was a trail from one to
three metres wide, cut out in the solid rock and skirting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-451" id="Pg_2-451"></a>[<a href="./images/2-451.png">451</a>]</span>
all along the foaming river, which flowed in the
opposite direction from that in which we were travelling.
In several places narrow tunnels had been excavated
in the rock, through which the trail proceeded. These
tunnels were dangerous when you encountered caravans
of pack animals coming through from the opposite
direction. The animals often got jammed in the
middle of the tunnel, tearing their loads to pieces in
their attempts to disentangle themselves. Once I got
jammed myself, and came out minus a patch of skin
several inches long from my left shin and knee.</p>

<p>Between La Merced and S. Ramon, a distance
of some 10 kil., one had to cross the shaky suspension
bridges of La Herreria and S. Ramon. The oscillations
of those bridges were so great that it was always a
marvel to me that the animals and riders were not
precipitated into the river below. The planks of the
bridges were in many places so rotten that it was
not uncommon for the animals to put their legs right
through them. Only one animal at a time could go
across, as the bridges were not strong enough to
support more.</p>

<p>Farther on we arrived at two more bridges&mdash;the
Puntayacu and the Rio Seco, one a suspension bridge,
the other built of masonry. One met hundreds of
Indians upon the trail, in costumes resembling those
of the Calabrese of Italy. The men wore heavy
woollen hand-knitted stockings up to their knees, or
else over their trousers, white leggings left open
behind as far down as the knee. Round felt hats were
worn by the women, who were garbed in bright blue
or red petticoats, very full and much pleated, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-452" id="Pg_2-452"></a>[<a href="./images/2-452.png">452</a>]</span>
quite short. Red was the favourite colour for the
shawl which they threw round the body and over the
shoulders.</p>

<p>When we proceeded the next morning the heat
in the low valley was stifling. The scenery continued
to be beautiful, with magnificent waterfalls and torrents
flowing down at a steep angle among rocks.</p>

<p>I stopped for the night at the charming little
hotel of Huacapistana, situated at a lower level than
the road in a most picturesque narrow valley, on the
right bank of the Tarma River. The distance between
La Merced and Huacapistana was about 35 kil.</p>

<p>Between Huacapistana and Tarma the track was
excellent. We went through the Carpapata tunnel,
184 m. long&mdash;very dark and narrow, and extremely
dangerous if you happened to meet pack animals in
the middle. The scenery was enchanting and the
vegetation wonderful until, 20 kil. farther, I entered,
by a magnificent avenue of eucalyptus trees, the most
picturesque town of the higher Andes, Tarma. The
narrow, neat streets were paved with cobble-stones.
All the houses were painted white, and had red-tiled
roofs. The streets swarmed with quaintly attired
Indians and tidily dressed Peruvians. There were
many Italians and Spaniards in Tarma. Two or three
hotels existed here&mdash;a capital one, actually lighted by
electric light, being kept by a most honest Italian.
The elevation of Tarma, taken by the hypsometrical
apparatus, was 10,034 ft.</p>

<p class="fsc">Entrance to Inca Subterranean Passages.</p>
<hr />
<p>I left Tarma on January 29th, following a well-cultivated
valley, fairly thickly inhabited. We were
travelling over a good mule-track, swarming with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-453" id="Pg_2-453"></a>[<a href="./images/2-453.png">453</a>]</span>
Indians, donkeys, mules, and horses. The mud houses
and land on either side were enclosed by hedges of
cacti, or by walls. We were between barren mountains
of a brownish colour, against which the quaint,
brightly-coloured costumes of the many people on
the road were thrown out in vivid contrast. Most
of the houses were constructed of large mud bricks,
sun-dried. The crops seemed to consist chiefly of
Indian corn. As we went farther, among dark brown
rocks and limestone, we came to grottoes and rock
habitations. At some remote period there must have
been a great upheaval in that country&mdash;at least,
judging by the sedimentary foliated rock, the strata
of which were from one to three feet thick, and which
had originally been deposited horizontally by water.
These accumulations or sediments now stood up at an
angle of 45&deg;. We were now in a region where llamas
were plentiful&mdash;most delightful animals, with their
pointed ears pricked up, their luxuriant coats, and
stumpy curled tails.</p>

<p>We came to a steep ascent over a high pass, where
the cold wind was fierce. On reaching the pass I
found myself on a grassy plateau in which were to
be seen two circles of stones by the side of each
other.</p>

<p>The partition of the waters flowing into the River
Mantaro and the River Tarma took place at the point
called Ricran, not far from the high pass we had
crossed. It was always advisable when taking the
journey between Tarma and Oroya to start early in
the morning, so as to be on that pass before noon.
In the afternoon the wind was intensely cold and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-454" id="Pg_2-454"></a>[<a href="./images/2-454.png">454</a>]</span>
frequently accompanied by violent storms of hail
and rain.</p>

<p>I arrived in the evening at Oroya, the distance
from Tarma being 30 kil. 236 m. The journey between
the two places could be accomplished on a good mule
in five or six hours. Oroya was an important point
for me, as it was there that I saw the first railway
since leaving Araguary in Brazil nearly a year before.</p>

<p>Oroya is perhaps one of the highest railway stations
in the world, its accurate elevation by boiling-point
thermometers being 12,156 ft.</p>

<p>The town, like all termini of railway lines, was not
an attractive place. There were two or three hotels,
all extremely bad. One began to feel the effects of
civilization in the dishonesty of the people.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, thanks to arrangements
made by Mr. D. T. Lee, I was allowed to take the
journey to Lima in a "gravity car," in the company
of the engineer, Mr. Beverley R. Mayer, instead of
by the usual train, which ran twice a week. Of
course it was only possible to go by "gravity car"
from the highest point of the railway, which is not at
Oroya, but at the tunnel of Galera, 5,356 m. (17,572 ft.)
above the sea-level as measured by the railway
surveyors.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-454a.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-454a_th.jpg" alt="Inca Place of Amusement: a Toboggan Slide of Rock." title="Inca Place of Amusement: a Toboggan Slide of Rock." /></a></p>

<p class="fsc">An Inca Grave, Bolivia.</p>
<hr />
<p>The scenery was magnificent on that railway.
Having gone through the Galera tunnel, Mr. Mayer
and I got on the small "gravity car," keeping all
the time just in front of the train. It was quite an
exciting journey, the incline being so great that we
soon acquired a vertiginous speed&mdash;in fact, too much,
because our brakes would not act any more. With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-455" id="Pg_2-455"></a>[<a href="./images/2-455.png">455</a>]</span>
the snow and rain the rails had become so slippery
that we went sliding down at the most alarming pace.
Nor did I feel particularly happy at having the train
only a few hundred metres behind us. Whenever we
got to a station, we had to get off quickly and get
our car off the rails to give room to the incoming
train. The cold was intense.</p>

<p>The geological formation of the Andes in that
particular region was remarkable, and more remarkable
still was the British engineering triumph of
constructing a railway from the sea to so high an
elevation. In one or two places there were iron bridges
of great height and ingenious construction. You felt
a curious sensation as you flew over those bridges on
the tiny car, and you saw between the rails the chasm
underneath you; nor did you feel extraordinarily
comfortable when, hundreds of feet down, down
below, at the bottom of one chasm, you saw a railway
engine which had leapt the rails and lay upside
down in the middle of a foaming torrent.</p>

<p>Naturally, in building a mountain railway of that
type, a great many curves and zigzags were necessary,
many of those curves taking place inside tunnels.
Along the railway rivers have been switched off through
tunnels within the mountain, and produced picturesque
cascades where they came out again.</p>

<p>The geological surprises were continual. Next to
mountains with perfectly horizontal strata you saw
other mountains with strata in a vertical position,
especially in the limestone formation. Farther down
immense superposed terraces were to be noticed upon
the mountain side, evidently made by the ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-456" id="Pg_2-456"></a>[<a href="./images/2-456.png">456</a>]</span>
dwellers of that country for the cultivation of their
inhospitable land.</p>

<p>This interested me greatly. I had seen among
the Igorrotes or head-hunters of the island of Luzon,
in the Philippine Archipelago, that same method of
irrigation, by collecting the water from a high point
on the mountain side in order to irrigate consecutively
the series of terraces. Not only was I struck by the
fact of finding so unusual a method of cultivation at
two points of the globe so far apart, but I was even
more impressed by the wonderful resemblance in type
between the local natives and the inhabitants of the
northern island of the Philippines. Undoubtedly these
people came from the same stock.</p>

<p>Where we stopped at the different stations there
was always something interesting to observe&mdash;now
the hundreds of llamas which had conveyed goods
to the railway; at one place the numberless sacks of
ore waiting to be taken to the coast; at another
the tall active chimneys of the smelters, which
suggested industry on a large scale. I took a number
of photographs under difficulties on that journey down
the Andes.</p>

<p>At 7.30 p.m. on January 30th, 1912, I arrived
safely at Lima, a distance of 222 kil. from Oroya.
The total distance from Iquitos to Lima over the
Andes was 2,079 kil., which distance I had performed
in the record time of one month, the time generally
occupied by the usual travellers being from fifty to
seventy days.</p>

<p class="fsc">Inca Remains near Cuzco.</p>
<hr />
<p>From Lima I proceeded early the next morning
to Callao, the port for Lima, a few kilometres farther,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-457" id="Pg_2-457"></a>[<a href="./images/2-457.png">457</a>]</span>
where at La Punta I touched the Pacific Ocean, thus
ending my trans-continental journey from Rio de
Janeiro, with its zigzags and deviations, 22,000 kil.
in length, or 13,750 miles.</p>

<p>I was already in better health when I reached
Lima. The violent changes of climate from the hot
valley of the Amazon to the snows of the Andes,
and from there to the sea-coast, had had a beneficial
effect upon me. The attack of beri-beri from which
I had been suffering was gradually passing away, my
right foot, by the time I reached Lima, having slowly
got back almost to its normal size, although my toes
were still atrophied. It is well known that there is
no better cure for beri-beri than sea air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lima</span> is a beautiful city, as everybody knows. Its
wonderful churches, its clean streets, its commerce,
the great charm of the people&mdash;indeed, the Peruvians
are the most cultivated and polished people in South

it one of the most attractive cities I visited on that
continent.</p>

<p>I was, nevertheless, anxious to return quickly to
Europe. I had no strength left. The mental strain
on that long journey had been so great that I had
lost my memory altogether.</p>

<p>Owing to the great kindness of the British Minister,
Mr. C. des Graz, and of Mr. Mockill, the chief of the

<hr />
<p>I left Lima five days after my arrival, on February
5th, going by steamer to the port of Mollendo, where
I arrived on February 7th. There I met the railway
line of the Peruvian Corporation from the sea coast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-459" id="Pg_2-459"></a>[<a href="./images/2-459.png">459</a>]</span>
to Arequipa and Cuzco. A magnificent private car
had been placed at my disposal by the Peruvian
Corporation, in which I was able to make myself
comfortable for the several days which the journey
lasted. Not only so, but the Peruvian Corporation
kindly looked after my welfare in a most thoughtful
way during the whole time I travelled on their
line, for which I am indeed extremely grateful, as the
travelling in that country would have otherwise been
less pleasant.</p>

<p>The railroad from Mollendo went along the coast
among curious eroded rocks of great interest; then
gradually left the sea among sand-dunes and mounds
upon the wide beach.</p>

<p>As the railway began to get higher and higher
upon the steep gradient the scenery became more
and more beautiful. Presently we found ourselves
overlooking a wonderful flat valley between two high
hill ranges in lovely green patches, cut with geometrical
precision, and well cultivated. Giant cacti
of the candelabrum type were plentiful. Farther on
we got upon an elevated plateau with a white surface
of pumice-stone, followed by red volcanic sand&mdash;an
immense stretch of country surrounded by low hills
of grey tufa and red volcanic rock.</p>

<p>Beyond that we came to a most interesting region
of sand-dunes of extraordinary shapes, where the
under soil was of a brilliant red, while the sand
accumulations were of a grey colour. Some of the
dunes were crescent-shaped. They stood usually in
sets or rows extending from north-west to south-east.
Then there were high mounds, also of sand, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-460" id="Pg_2-460"></a>[<a href="./images/2-460.png">460</a>]</span>
dunes of all kinds, some with a double crescent,
or with the inside of the crescent much indented,
others with multiple concave curves. The concavity
of all those dunes was on the north-east side.</p>

<p>I had seen a similar formation of dunes in the
Salt Desert of Persia; also in the south-western desert
of Afghanistan and in the northern desert of Beluchistan;
but I do not remember ever having seen such
a perfect formation of dunes as that to be seen in
this part of Peru.</p>

<p>Beyond that sandy zone we had before us a red
plateau with fluted sides. Great mounds of blackened
volcanic sand were quite frequent, the railway winding
its way around immense basins formed by depressions
in the land. Then we entered a beautiful green narrow
valley along a streamlet intersecting the plateau.</p>

<p>From Mollendo the railway gradually rose to an
elevation of 2,301 m. (7,549 ft.) at Arequipa, where
I remained for the night.</p>

<p class="fsc">The Great Inca Ruins of Viraccocha, in Tinta (Cuzco).</p>
<hr />
<p>Arequipa was an interesting city with its picturesque
arcades, its magnificent church of Spanish architecture
with marvellous ancient wood carvings, and its prettily-laid-out
gardens. I visited the astronomical observatory
of Harvard College, a few miles from the town,
where excellent work is being done in star photography
from that eminently suitable spot for the study of
the sky. The observatory was situated at an elevation
of 8,060 ft. It worked in conjunction with the Harvard
observatory in North America. By having thus one
station north and another south of the equator, the
observations made by that institution included the
stars in all parts of the sky from the North to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-461" id="Pg_2-461"></a>[<a href="./images/2-461.png">461</a>]</span>
South Pole. A 24-inch Bruce photographic telescope,
a 13-inch Boyden telescope, an 8-inch Bache telescope,
and a 4-inch meridian photometer were the principal
instruments used at the Arequipa station.</p>

<p>I left Arequipa on the morning of February 9th,
going through country of volcanic tufa and red sand,
with immense furrows quite devoid of vegetation.
Occasionally we came upon great masses of boulders
cast by some volcanic force upon the surface of tufa
and sand. Then the railway gracefully climbed in
great curves over a plateau nearly 14,000 ft. high,
where tufts of grass could be seen, giving a greenish
appearance to the landscape.</p>

<p>We travelled along that great table-land, occasionally
seeing a herd of llamas stampede away at the
approach of the train, now and then observing circular
stone walls erected by shepherds as shelters. A
gable-roofed hut was occasionally seen. Picturesque
natives in their <i>ponchos</i> and red or yellow scarves
gazed, astonished, at the train throbbing along slowly
upon the steep gradient of that elevated barren
country. The cold seemed intense after the tropical
heat of Lima. It was snowing hard. In the daytime
I generally travelled seated in front of the engine,
in order to have a better view of the landscape. In
the train everybody suffered from <i>soroche</i> or mountain-sickness,
which attacked most people when brought
up quickly by the railway from the sea to such high
elevations. I was driven away from the front of the
engine by the cold rain and sleet beating with great
force into my face, and obscuring the landscape to
such an extent that I could see nothing at all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-462" id="Pg_2-462"></a>[<a href="./images/2-462.png">462</a>]</span>
When it cleared up we were travelling in a region
of marshes and pools in the lowest point of depressions,
then along a magnificent lake with green and brown
fantastically-shaped mountains and hills in the foreground,
and a high snowy range in the background.
The effects of light when the storm was raging over
the lake, with its conical and semi-spherical islands
dotting the water, were intensely picturesque.</p>

<p>After that the plateau became less interesting.
We descended gradually some 400 m. (1,312 ft.) to
the junction of Juliaca, 3,825 m. (12,550 ft.) above
the sea level.</p>

<p>At that place the luxurious car which had taken
me there had to be switched off from the Puno Line
to the Cuzco Line.</p>

<p>I had dinner in the hotel, and again was impressed
by the great honesty of the Peruvian people in the
interior, and their considerate manners. It was somewhat
curious to see the Indian waiter&mdash;most clumsy,
dressed up in uncomfortable and ill-fitting European
clothes&mdash;waiting on a medley of strange passengers, such
as red-faced Spanish priests, tidy, smooth, oily-haired
Peruvians, and talkative commercial travellers. But all&mdash;whether
fat or lean, rich or poor, Indian or Peruvian&mdash;were
the essence of politeness and thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>Being able to sleep in the luxurious car, where
I had two good bedrooms, my own kitchen, and a
sitting-room, I was indeed extremely comfortable.</p>

<p>I left again on February 10th over a great flat
grassy tableland, with hills terraced up for cultivation.
We passed an old church with a wonderful dome,
and behind it snow-capped blue mountains.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-463" id="Pg_2-463"></a>[<a href="./images/2-463.png">463</a>]</span>
The women wore peculiar hats with flapping edges
in order to protect their faces from the wind. A black
cloth was generally worn over the women's heads
under the hat, while over their shoulders hung dark
green or purple <i>ponchos</i>.</p>

<p>The Indians of that region showed remarkably strong
Malay features.</p>

<p>The train steamed through the wide grassy valley,
once crossing a fairly large stream. High snowy
peaks loomed against the sky on our right, while we
were travelling all the time at elevations varying from
3,531 m. (11,584 ft.) at Sicuani to 4,313 m. (14,150 ft.)
at La Raya. The cold seemed intense. I got quite
frozen sitting on the engine.</p>

<p>Quantities of llamas and sheep grazing were now
to be seen on the land, foot-passengers and horsemen
crossing the valley in all directions. At the stations
large crowds of picturesque women squatted down
selling pottery and fruit.</p>

<p>The farther we got into the interior the more
picturesque the hats became. The women there wore
hats with rectangular gold-braided brims, and with
white, red or blue curtains at the sides. The men
had pointed woollen caps with ear-flaps. The women
were garbed in ample pleated skirts. Curiously
enough, while the head and body were so well protected,
most of them had bare legs and feet, the skirts
reaching only just below the knee.</p>

<p>Near villages one saw neat patches of land
turned, with trouble, into vegetable gardens. Stone
enclosures were used by the natives as shelters for
the animals during storms and to pen them up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-464" id="Pg_2-464"></a>[<a href="./images/2-464.png">464</a>]</span>
at night. The people themselves lived in stone
huts.</p>

<p>The country reminded me forcibly of Tibet, and
so, in a way, did the people&mdash;short and stumpy and
smothered in clothes. I frequently noticed cairns
of stones like the <i>obos</i> typical of Tibet and of the
Himahlyas. There, too, as in Tibet, it seemed the
fashion for passers-by to place a white stone on those
cairns in order to bring good luck.</p>

<p>The men were curiously garbed in short, wide
white woollen trouserettes, reaching just below the
knees and split behind just over the calf. Under
those they wore another pair of trousers, slightly
longer. Their coats were short and tight, resembling
Eton jackets. They wore wide and much embroidered
belts, red and blue being their favourite colours.</p>

<p>An accident had happened to a bridge. It had
collapsed, so that the trains could not proceed. Thanks
to the great thoughtfulness of Mr. Mockill and his
inspector of the line, Mr. Blaisdell, another private
car, equally comfortable, had been sent down from
Cuzco to the bridge. My baggage was transferred
on men's backs to the opposite side of the stream.
With the delay of only an hour or so I was able to
proceed on another train to Cuzco, where I arrived
that same evening.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-464.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-464_th.jpg" alt="Inca Pottery, Weapons and Ornaments of Gold and Copper." title="Inca Pottery, Weapons and Ornaments of Gold and Copper." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">Inca Pottery, Weapons and Ornaments of Gold and Copper.</p>
<hr />
<p>The city of Cuzco is situated at an elevation of
11,062 ft. above the sea level. In its vicinity the
most important remains of Inca civilization have
been found. The city itself was most interesting. Its
handsome Spanish cathedral had a fa&ccedil;ade of beautifully
designed columns and a fine central doorway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-465" id="Pg_2-465"></a>[<a href="./images/2-465.png">465</a>]</span>
The great bell in one of the towers contained a
large quantity of gold in the bronze, giving wonderful
resonance to its vibrating notes. A solid silver altar
of great height was to be admired in the interior
of the cathedral, while the chancel was of marvellously
carved wood. So was a supplementary altar which
had been stored away behind the silver one.</p>

<p>The principal square of Cuzco had recently been
paved with cement, on which none of the natives
could be induced to walk, as they were afraid of slipping,
accustomed as they were to the roughest cobble-stone
paving of their streets. Only the gentry of the
city could be seen treading with great care on the
polished pavement, and were looked upon with much
admiration by the lower natives, who stared aghast
from the porticoes around the square. In the centre
of the square was a cheap terra-cotta statue of the
Indian hero Atahualpa surmounting a fountain painted
of a ghastly green. The gardens were nicely laid
out with pretty lawns. Another beautiful church rose
in the <i>plaza</i>, the doorway of which was also handsome,
but not comparable in beauty with that of the cathedral.
The stone carvings of its fa&ccedil;ade were nevertheless
remarkable. There were arcades on three sides of
the <i>plaza</i>, the houses being generally only one storey
high above them. The buildings were painted light
blue, pink, green, or bright yellow, the columns of
beautifully cut stone being also covered with hideous
paint to match.</p>

<p>Thanks to the kindness of the President of the
Republic, Mr. B. B. Legujia, a telegram had been sent
asking the Prefect of Cuzco to give me every possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-466" id="Pg_2-466"></a>[<a href="./images/2-466.png">466</a>]</span>
assistance in visiting the Inca ruins in the neighbourhood.
The Prefect, Mr. J. J. V. Cu&ntilde;er, kindly placed
at my disposal three excellent horses and an orderly.</p>

<p>It is seldom one can visit a place where the people
have more primitive habits than in the city of Cuzco.
The streets, so wonderfully picturesque, were not
fit to walk upon. The people threw into them all
that can be thrown out of the houses, which possess
no sanitary arrangements of any kind. Much of the
pleasure of looking at the magnificent Inca walls&mdash;constructed
of great blocks of stone so well fitted
that no cement was necessary to hold them together&mdash;was
really lost through being absolutely stifled by
the suffocating odour which was everywhere prevalent
in Cuzco.</p>

<p>The photographs that are reproduced in the illustrations
of this book will give an idea of the grandeur
of the Inca works better than any description. As
I intend to produce at a later date a special work
on that country, I am unable here to go fully into
the history of the marvellous civilization of that
race.</p>

<p>A photograph will be seen in one of the illustrations
showing the immensity of the three-walled fortress
of Sacsayhuaman. Another photograph will show
with what accuracy the Incas could carve stone&mdash;which,
mind you, in those days must have been much
softer than it is now, and not unlike the sandstone
that is used in England for building purposes.</p>

<p>Many curious subterranean passages were to be
found on the mountains near Cuzco, the entrances
to which were among picturesque rocks. The Incas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-467" id="Pg_2-467"></a>[<a href="./images/2-467.png">467</a>]</span>
seemed to have a regular mania for carving steps
and angular channels in rocks. Not far from the
fortress could be found the place of recreation of the
Incas&mdash;the Rodadeiro&mdash;over which the Incas tobogganed,
perhaps sitting on hides. Thousands and
thousands of people must have gone in for the sport,
as the solid rock was deeply grooved by the friction
of the persons who have slid on it.</p>

<p>The remains of ancient altars for the worship of
the sun and an Inca throne, where the king of the Incas
must have sat while battles were taking place, were
indeed most interesting to examine.</p>

<p>More interesting than any other to me was the particular
spot on the mountain side where a kind of throne
existed carved out of a huge block of rock, and where
a battle of the Incas against their enemies could be
reconstructed. Mounds of ammunition, consisting of
round stones as big as a lawn-tennis ball, had been
accumulated above and near the throne. Just below
that high spot I found scattered upon the mountain
side quantities of ammunition which had evidently
been thrown by the Incas at the attacking foes.</p>

<p>Farther on was the "round table" where the
Incas had their feasts&mdash;a huge circular table of rock
situated near a conical boulder of immense size.</p>

<p>Interesting fountains with carved figure-heads;
an Inca bath of graceful lines; and, some kilometres
beyond Cuzco, the marvellous ruins of Viraccocha at
Tinta, where gigantic walls of a palace were to be seen
standing, and ruins of other fortresses filled one with
amazement.</p>

<p>On the mountain side near the town were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-468" id="Pg_2-468"></a>[<a href="./images/2-468.png">468</a>]</span>
strange gateways of Choquechaca, which in their
lines resembled ancient Egyptian buildings. Not far
off were the blocks of rock to which the Incas fastened
their prisoners by their legs, arms and heads, and
exposed them to the ridicule of the populace.</p>

<p>Many were the wonderful things which had been
found in digging near Cuzco; but most interesting of
all to me were the deformed crania&mdash;some flattened
to almost an incredible extent on the top, others
elongated backward to an amazing degree, others
still with the central part of the skull deeply depressed,
so as to form two globular swellings at the sides.
Others, again, had been squeezed so as to form an
angular ridge longitudinally on the summit. One
skull particularly interested me, which had a pronounced
elongation backward, and a dent just above
the forehead which must have been caused by tying
the cranium while young and still in a soft condition.
Most of the skulls were of gigantic size when compared
with those of modern times. The lower part was under-developed.
Many of them possessed magnificent teeth.</p>

<p>Several of the skulls had been trephined, evidently
while the person was still alive, some of the perforations
in the brain-case being circular in shape, others
quadrangular&mdash;most of the trephinations having been
made in the forehead, others on the top of the skull.
I saw one skull with as many as eleven apertures
thus made. The operation had evidently been performed
by a very able surgeon, for the little cap of
bone removed fitted beautifully into the opening that
had been made.</p>

<hr />
<p>The Incas were great architects. They had an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-469" id="Pg_2-469"></a>[<a href="./images/2-469.png">469</a>]</span>
absolute craving for carving rock. They made models
of their fortresses and palaces in blocks of hard stone,
some of these being of remarkable perfection in their
detail.</p>

<p>The pottery, red earthen vessels with geometrical
designs upon them, was most interesting, especially the
large jars which must have been used for fermenting
wine. Those jars of a typical shape must have rested
on a pedestal of wood, as they ended in a point
at the bottom, which prevented their standing up
on a flat surface. Two handles were attached to the
lower part of those jars, and also to the great bottles
in which they kept wine.</p>

<p>The Incas used tumblers, enamelled in red and
green, and of most graceful shape.</p>

<p>They were fond of ornamenting their bottles and
vessels with representations of human heads, reproduced
with considerable artistic fidelity. Other bottles represented
strange gnawing faces, with expanded eyes and a
fierce moustache.</p>

<p>Judging from the representations of figures on
their jars, the people in those days wore their hair
in little plaits round the head. Heads of llamas
sculptured in stone or else modelled in earthenware
were used as vessels.</p>

<p>The Incas made serviceable mortars for grinding
grain, of polished hard rock, mostly of a circular
shape, seldom more than two feet in diameter.</p>

<p>The matrimonial stone was interesting enough.
It was a double vessel carved out of a solid stone, a
perforation being made in the partition between the
two vessels. It seems, when marriages were per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-470" id="Pg_2-470"></a>[<a href="./images/2-470.png">470</a>]</span>formed,
that the Incas placed a red liquid in one
vessel and some water in the other, the perforation
in the central partition being stopped up until the
ceremony took place, when the liquids were allowed
to mingle in emblem of the union of the two lives.
Curious, too, was the pipe-like arrangement, called
the <i>kenko</i>, ornamented with a carved jaguar head,
also used at their marriage ceremonies.</p>

<p class="fsc">Guaqui, the Port for La Paz on Lake Titicaca.</p>
<hr />
<p>Their stone axes and other implements were
of extraordinary interest&mdash;their rectangularly-shaped
stone knives, the star- and cross-shaped heads for
their war clubs, as well as the star-shaped weights
which they used for offensive purposes, attached,
perhaps, to a sling. Many were the weapons of offence
made of stone which have been found near Cuzco,
some of which were used by holding in the hand,
others attached to sticks.</p>

<p>The Incas were fairly good sculptors, not only
in stone but also in moulding human figures and
animals in silver and gold. Llamas, deer, long-nosed
human-faced idols were represented by them with
fidelity of detail, although perhaps not so much
accuracy in the general proportions. At a later date
the Incas used metal implements, such as small rakes
and chisels for smoothing rock. They made hair-pins
and ear-rings, chiefly of a mixture of gold, silver,
lead and copper.</p>

<p>I saw at Cuzco a stone arrangement which was
used by the Incas for washing and milling gold. Many
ornaments of silex, agate and emerald, and also of
coral, which had evidently been brought there from
the coast, have also been found near Cuzco.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-471" id="Pg_2-471"></a>[<a href="./images/2-471.png">471</a>]</span>
The spoons and knives which the Incas used were
generally made of gold, with representations of heads
attached to them. The average length of these
articles was from two to four inches.</p>

<p>I left the city on Friday, February 16th, going back
the way I had come as far as the junction of Juliaca.</p>

<p>The Cuzco railway, to my mind, crosses the most
beautiful and most interesting scenery of any railway
I have ever seen. It is a pity that more English
people do not travel by it. The great elevation
makes people suffer from mountain-sickness, and that
perhaps deters many travellers from attempting the
journey. The railway has to contend with great
natural difficulties&mdash;land-slides, which often stop traffic
for days at a time, being frequent.</p>

<p>From Cuzco I went direct to Lake Titicaca, where
more Inca ruins, such as the cylindrical towers of
Sillistayni, existed at Puno. Lake Titicaca is a heavenly
sheet of water, situated at an elevation by hypsometrical
apparatus of 12,202 ft. With its magnificent
background of snowy peaks, the lake looked indeed
too impressive for words, as I steamed across it in
the excellent steamer of the Peruvian Corporation.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of February 17th, having
travelled the entire night in order to cross the lake
from north to south, we arrived at Guaqui, the port
for La Paz, the capital of Bolivia. Although I travelled
in the most luxurious comfort, owing to the kindness
of the Peruvian Corporation, the journey by rail
and the going about examining the ruins at Cuzco
had tired me considerably. My brain was so exhausted
that it would really take in no more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-472" id="Pg_2-472"></a>[<a href="./images/2-472.png">472</a>]</span>
Worse luck, when I reached La Paz it was during
carnival time, when it was impossible to go out of
the hotel without being smothered in cornflour or
chalk, and sprinkled with aniline dyed water. Even
bottles of ink were emptied on one's head from the
windows. So that, although I crossed Bolivia from
one end to the other in its longest part, I was unable
to do any further work. I tried to get down to the
coast as quickly as possible in order to return home.</p>

<p>La Paz was a beautiful city, extremely neat, with
bright red-tiled roofs and white buildings. It was
situated in a deep hollow surrounded by a great
barrier of mountains. So deep and sudden was the
hollow that within a few metres of its upper edge one
would never suppose a town to be at hand. Bolivia
is a go-ahead country in which English people are
greatly interested. We have in our Minister there,
Mr. Gosling, a very able representative of British
interests.</p>

<p>Bolivians have shown great enterprise in building
railways in all directions in order properly to develop
their enormously wealthy country. Many important
lines are in construction; others are projected&mdash;of
which, perhaps, the most interesting will be the one
from Santa Cruz to Corumba on the Brazilian boundary.</p>

<p>The day will come when the port of Arica on the
Pacific Ocean will be joined to Oruro, on the Antofagasta
line, the well-known junction in Bolivia,
and eventually to Santa Cruz. The present plan is
to build a line from the already existing railway at
Cochabamba to Porto Velarde on the Rio Grande
(Rio Mamore), then to Santa Cruz. The Brazilians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-473" id="Pg_2-473"></a>[<a href="./images/2-473.png">473</a>]</span>
on their side will eventually connect S&atilde;o Paulo with
Cuyaba and Corumba. It will then be possible to
travel by rail right across the South American continent
in its richest part.</p>

<p>There is also a project of connecting Santa
Cruz with Embarcacion and Campo Santo, in the
Argentine Republic, and eventually with the Trans-Andine
Railway.</p>

<p>Other smaller lines projected are those between
Potos&iacute; and Sucre, and one from the Chilian boundary
at La Quiada to Tarija. That system of railways
will greatly develop the entire southern portion of
Bolivia. A small railway is also proposed in the
most northern part of the Republic, between Riberalta
on the River Madre de Dios and Guajara Merim on the
Madeira-Mamore railway, a district of immense wealth
for the production of rubber.</p>

<p>The exact elevation of La Paz by hypsometrical
apparatus was 12,129 ft.</p>

<p>I left La Paz on February 21st, and travelled through
flat, alluvial, uninteresting country&mdash;only a huge flock
of llamas or vicu&ntilde;as enlivening the landscape here
and there, or a group of Indians in their picturesque
costumes. The women, with their green, violet or
red shawls and much-pleated short skirts, generally
blue, afforded particularly gay patches of colour.</p>

<p>I saw a beautiful effect of mirage near the lake
in the vicinity of Oruro, as I was on the railway to
Antofagasta. We were going through flat country
most of the time. It had all the appearance of
having once been a lake bottom. Perhaps that great
Titicaca Lake formerly extended as far south as Lake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-474" id="Pg_2-474"></a>[<a href="./images/2-474.png">474</a>]</span>
Poopo, which is connected with Lake Titicaca by the
River Desaguadero. In fact, if I am not far wrong,
the two lakes formed part, in days gone by, of one
single immense lake. The mountains on our right as we
went southwards towards Oruro showed evidence that
the level of the then united lakes must have reached,
in days gone by, some 150 ft. higher than the plain
on which we were travelling. The low undulations
on our left had evidently been formed under water
in the lake bottom.</p>

<p>The junction of Oruro, from which the Cochabamba
railway branches, was quite a large place, of 8,000
inhabitants, but with no particularly striking buildings.
Tin and silver mining was carried on in the surrounding
mountains.</p>

<p>From Oruro I continued the journey to Antofagasta
via Uyuni. Immense deposits of borax were to be
seen all along the line from the station of Ulaca;
then we came to a most beautiful sight&mdash;the volcano
of Ollag&uuml;e, 12,123 ft. above the sea level. It looked
like a giant dome, snow-capped, and smoking on
its southern side. Its slopes were fairly regular, and
of most brilliant colouring, red and blue. Near the
volcano were mounds of mud and shattered rock.
Ollag&uuml;e stood on the boundary between Bolivia and
Chile.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/ill2-474.jpg"><img src="./images/ill2-474_th.jpg" alt="On the Andes." title="On the Andes." /></a></p>
<p class="fsc">On the Andes.</p>
<hr />
<p>After passing San Martin, the first station on the
Chilian side, the railway skirted the bed of an ancient
lake, an immense circular flat stretch with deposits
of sand and borax, in which could be seen occasional
pools of stagnant water. On the west side stood a
high three-peaked mountain covered with snow, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-475" id="Pg_2-475"></a>[<a href="./images/2-475.png">475</a>]</span>
at the southern end of that plain was a charming
lakelet. We had no sooner left this beautiful view
than we had before us to the south-west an immense
conical mountain, flat-topped. It looked just like
the well-known Fujiyama of Japan, only more regular
in its sloping lines.</p>

<p>We passed the works of a Borax Company, which
were between the stations of Sebollar and Ascotan.
There was to be seen another immense lake of borax,
some 40 kil. (24 miles) long.</p>

<p>I arrived that evening at Antofagasta, and was
fortunate enough to get on board one of the Pacific
Mail Line steamers the next morning on my way to
Valparaiso. We were now in the height of civilization
again&mdash;very hot, very uncomfortable, very ambitious,
very dirty, the hotels abominable. Had it not been
for the kindness of friends I should have fared badly
indeed in Valparaiso, for the place was invaded by a
swarm of American tourists, who had just landed
from an excursion steamer and rendered the place
unbearable.</p>

<p>From Valparaiso, as soon as it was possible to
obtain accommodation, I travelled across the Andes
and as far as Buenos Aires by the Trans-Andine
railway. The scenery on this line was most disappointing
to any one who has seen the Andes in their
real grandeur farther north; but for the average
traveller the journey may prove interesting enough,
although hot, dull, dusty, and not particularly comfortable.</p>

<p>While I was travelling on the railway between
Mendoza and Buenos Aires there was a serious strike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2-476" id="Pg_2-476"></a>[<a href="./images/2-476.png">476</a>]</span>
of railway employ&eacute;s. The railway had been attacked
at many different points. Amateur engineers
and attendants ran the trains. We were only two
hours from Buenos Aires. The heat and dust were
intense as we crossed the great pampas. The shaking
of the train had tired me to such an extent that I
placed a pillow on the ledge of the open window,
and was fast asleep with my head half outside the
carriage, when I woke up startled by the sound of
an explosion. I found myself covered with quantities
of d&eacute;bris of rock. A huge stone, as big as a man's
head or bigger, had been thrown with great force at
the passing train by the strikers, and had hit the
side of my window only about three inches above my
head, smashing the woodwork and tearing off the metal
frame of the window. Had it struck a little lower it
would have certainly ended my journey for good.</p>

<hr />
<p>As it was I arrived in Buenos Aires safely. A
few days later I was on my way to Rio de Janeiro,
by the excellent steamer <i>Aragon</i>. Shortly after, by
the equally good vessel <i>Araguaya</i>, of the Royal Mail
Steamship Company, I returned to England, where I
arrived in broken health on April 20th, 1912. It
was a relief to me to land at Southampton, with all my
notes, the eight hundred photographs I had taken, and
the maps which I had made of the regions traversed.</p>
